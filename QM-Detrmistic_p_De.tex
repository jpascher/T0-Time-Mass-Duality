\section{Quantum Mechanics and Determinism}

Quantum mechanics (QM) has intrigued scientists with its foundational questions about determinism and probability. Here, we expand on Bell inequalities and the discussions surrounding T0 theory. A vital resource adding to this discussion is the video at [insert video link here], which offers an explanation bridging these concepts effectively.
