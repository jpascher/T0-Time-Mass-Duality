## 🔍 Key Scientific Claims

### Theoretical Framework
1. **Single parameter suffices:** ξ = (4/3) × 10⁻⁴ derives all physical constants
2. **Fractal spacetime:** Universe has fractal dimension D_f ≈ 2.94
3. **Time-mass duality:** T_field · E_field = 1 fundamental relationship
4. **Deterministic QM:** Quantum mechanics without fundamental randomness

### Experimental Predictions
1. **Particle masses:** E = 1/ξ formula (98% accuracy achieved)
2. **Fine structure constant:** α ≈ 1/137 from geometric principles
3. **Muon g-2:** Anomaly resolved to 0.05σ
4. **Cosmology:** Alternatives to dark matter/dark energy

### Philosophical Implications
1. **Universe as brain:** Consciousness emerges from geometry
2. **Free will:** Structured indeterminacy from ξ-geometry
3. **Agency:** Requires fractal deviation from perfect coherence
4. **Constants circularity:** Only ξ is fundamental, rest derived
