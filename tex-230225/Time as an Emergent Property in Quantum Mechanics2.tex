	\section{Introduction}
	
	In modern physics, time and space are treated differently. While spatial coordinates in quantum mechanics are represented by operators, time primarily appears as a parameter. This asymmetric treatment raises fundamental questions about the nature of time. This work explores to what extent time can be understood as an emergent property related to fundamental constants and the mass of the system under consideration.
	
	\tableofcontents
	
	\section{Time in Special Relativity}
	
	Einstein's famous formula \(E = mc^2\) connects energy and mass via the speed of light. This relationship does not explicitly include a time variable. To establish a connection to time, additional physical relationships must be introduced.
	
	\subsection{Reformulation of the Energy-Mass Equivalence}
	
	Starting from \(E = mc^2\) and the quantum mechanical relationship between energy and frequency:
	\[
	E = mc^2
	\]
	\[
	E = h\nu = \frac{h}{T}
	\]
	
	where \(h\) is Planck's constant, \(\nu\) is the frequency, and \(T\) is the period. Equating these, we obtain:
	\[
	mc^2 = \frac{h}{T}
	\]
	\[
	T = \frac{h}{mc^2}
	\]
	
	This time \(T\) can be interpreted as a characteristic timescale associated with a mass \(m\).
	
	\section{Connection to the Fine-Structure Constant}
	
	The fine-structure constant \(\alpha\) is a dimensionless physical constant that describes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction:
	\[
	\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137.035999}
	\]
	
	\subsection{Derivation via Electromagnetic Constants}
	
	As shown in previous works, Planck's constant can be expressed in terms of electromagnetic vacuum constants:
	\[
	h = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}
	\]
	
	Using this relationship, the characteristic time \(T\) can be rewritten:
	\[
	T = \frac{h}{mc^2}
	\]
	\[
	= \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}} \cdot \frac{1}{mc^2}
	\]
	
	Since \(c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}\), we obtain:
	\[
	T = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}} \cdot \frac{1}{m \cdot \frac{1}{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}
	\]
	\[
	= \frac{1}{2\pi m c^3}
	\]
	
	\section{Time in Quantum Mechanics}
	
	\subsection{Standard Treatment of Time}
	
	In conventional quantum mechanics, time appears as a parameter in the Schrödinger equation:
	\[
	i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)
	\]
	
	Unlike spatial or momentum coordinates, there is no time operator. Time is treated as a continuous parameter along which quantum states evolve.
	
	\subsection{A New Perspective: Intrinsic Time}
	
	Consider the characteristic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) as an "intrinsic time" of a quantum object. This time depends on the object's mass and could be interpreted as the minimal timescale on which the object undergoes quantum mechanical changes. It arises directly from the equivalence of energy and mass and the quantum mechanical energy-frequency relationship, potentially representing a fundamental lower bound for temporal processes, as discussed later in the context of instantaneity.
	
	The Schrödinger equation could be modified to account for this intrinsic time:
	\[
	i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial (t/T)}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi
	\]
	
	This would imply that time evolution is no longer uniform for all objects but depends on their mass.
	
	\section{Linking Time, Mass, and the Fine-Structure Constant}
	
	\subsection{A Unified Relationship}
	
	Using the relationship \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) and the definition of the fine-structure constant, we can establish a direct connection:
	\[
	T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}
	\]
	\[
	= \frac{\hbar}{mc^2} \cdot \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c}{e^2} \cdot \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c}
	\]
	\[
	= \frac{\hbar^2 \cdot 4\pi\varepsilon_0 c}{mc^2 \cdot e^2} \cdot \alpha
	\]
	
	This shows that the intrinsic time \(T\) is proportional to the fine-structure constant \(\alpha\).
	
	\subsection{Interpretation in Natural Units}
	
	In a natural unit system where \(c = \hbar = 1\), this relationship simplifies to:
	\[
	T = \frac{\alpha}{m} \cdot \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{e^2}
	\]
	
	If we further set \(\alpha = 1\), as discussed in the main document, we obtain:
	\[
	T = \frac{1}{m} \cdot \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0}{e^2}
	\]
	
	In a fully natural system where \(e = 1\) and \(\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi}\), the relationship becomes even simpler:
	\[
	T = \frac{1}{m}
	\]
	
	This elegant relationship suggests that, in such a theoretical framework, the intrinsic time of an object is simply the inverse of its mass.
	
	\section{Implications for Physics}
	
	\subsection{A New Perspective on Time}
	
	The idea that time might be an emergent property dependent on mass and fundamental interaction constants has profound implications:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The conventional treatment of time as an independent parameter may be an approximation that works well for macroscopic objects.
		\item At a fundamental level, time could be a derived quantity rather than a fundamental one.
		\item The "speed" of time evolution might differ for various quantum objects depending on their mass.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Connection to Time Dilation}
	
	Interestingly, this perspective resembles relativistic time dilation, though from a completely different theoretical framework. While relativity predicts that moving clocks run slower, our approach suggests that more massive quantum objects might experience "faster" intrinsic time evolution.
	
	\section{A Unified Picture of Time, Mass, and Interaction}
	
	The reformulation presented here connects three fundamental aspects of physics:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The relativistic energy-mass relationship (\(E = mc^2\))
		\item The quantum mechanical energy-frequency relationship (\(E = h\nu\))
		\item The electromagnetic interaction strength (fine-structure constant \(\alpha\))
	\end{itemize}
	
	This hints at a deeper connection between these seemingly distinct aspects of reality and could be seen as a step toward a more comprehensive theory.
	
	\section{Experimental Verification Possibilities}
	
	The concept of mass-dependent intrinsic time could have experimental consequences:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Differences in coherence times of quantum systems with different masses
		\item Mass-dependent phase shifts in quantum interference experiments
		\item Specific signatures in the spectroscopy of particles with varying masses
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Impact on Instantaneous Coherence in Quantum Mechanics}
	
	\subsection{The Problem of Instantaneous Coherence}
	
	Conventional quantum mechanics assumes that quantum superpositions and correlations extend instantaneously across an entire system. This is particularly evident in entangled states, where a measurement on one particle can have immediate effects on the state of another, spatially separated particle.
	
	In a framework with mass-dependent intrinsic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\), this assumption must be reconsidered.
	
	\subsection{Mass-Dependent Coherence Times}
	
	If the intrinsic time \(T\) is inversely proportional to mass \(m\), heavier particles have shorter intrinsic timescales. This could imply that coherence phenomena for heavier quantum objects occur more rapidly relative to their intrinsic timescale.
	
	Mathematically, this could be expressed through a modified decoherence rate:
	\[
	\Gamma_{\text{dec}} = \Gamma_0 \cdot \frac{mc^2}{\hbar}
	\]
	
	where \(\Gamma_0\) is the conventional decoherence rate. This suggests that heavier systems decohere more slowly in their intrinsic timescale but faster in an external laboratory time.
	
	\subsection{Mathematical Formulation for Multi-Particle Systems}
	
	For a system with two particles of different masses (\(m_1\) and \(m_2\)), the joint wavefunction \(\Psi(x_1, x_2, t)\) would have two distinct intrinsic timescales. The modified Schrödinger equation for this system could be formulated as:
	\[
	i (m_1 + m_2) c^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x_1, x_2, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(x_1, x_2, t)
	\]
	
	This implies that time evolution depends on the total mass of the system, providing a natural generalization of intrinsic time for multi-particle systems.
	
	\subsection{Effects on Entangled States}
	
	For entangled states with particles of different masses, such as:
	\[
	|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_{m_1} \otimes |1\rangle_{m_2} + |1\rangle_{m_1} \otimes |0\rangle_{m_2})
	\]
	
	the time evolution of the two components would differ:
	\[
	|\Psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0(t/T_1)\rangle_{m_1} \otimes |1(t/T_2)\rangle_{m_2} + |1(t/T_1)\rangle_{m_1} \otimes |0(t/T_2)\rangle_{m_2})
	\]
	
	with \(T_1 = \frac{\hbar}{m_1 c^2}\) and \(T_2 = \frac{\hbar}{m_2 c^2}\). However, coherence is constrained by the minimal timescale \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\), which follows from the energy-time uncertainty, as discussed later.
	
\subsection{Modified Dispersion Relation}

In standard quantum mechanics, the dispersion relation for a free particle wave is:
\[
\hbar \omega = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}
\]
This describes the frequency of a matter wave as a function of mass \(m\) and wavevector \(k\). With the introduction of intrinsic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) as a characteristic timescale, we must examine its effect on the wavefunction's time evolution.

Consider a plane wave of the form \(\Psi \sim e^{i(kx - \omega t)}\). If time evolution is scaled relative to the intrinsic time \(T\), we write the wavefunction as:
\[
\Psi \sim e^{i(kx - \omega t / T)}
\]
Here, time \(t\) is normalized by \(T\), modifying the effective frequency \(\omega_{\text{eff}}\). The phase of the wavefunction becomes:
\[
kx - \omega \frac{t}{T} = kx - \omega \frac{mc^2}{\hbar} t
\]
Thus, the effective frequency relative to the intrinsic timescale is:
\[
\omega_{\text{eff}} = \omega \cdot T = \omega \cdot \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}
\]
Substituting the standard frequency \(\omega = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}\):
\[
\omega_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{mc^2} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^2 c^2}
\]
This modified dispersion relation remains mass-dependent, unlike a mass-independent form that appeared as an artifact in earlier considerations. The dependence on \(m^2\) in the denominator indicates that heavier particles have a slower effective frequency, consistent with the interpretation of \(T\) as an intrinsic timescale.

Notably, this relation differs significantly from standard quantum mechanics, where \(\omega \propto \frac{1}{m}\). The new form \(\omega_{\text{eff}} \propto \frac{1}{m^2}\) could lead to experimental differences in the propagation of matter waves, particularly for particles of different masses, serving as a potential test for the mass-dependent time theory.
\subsection{New Interpretation for the EPR Paradox and Bell's Inequalities}

Our mass-dependent time theory could offer new interpretive possibilities for the EPR paradox and Bell's inequalities. If time is an emergent, mass-dependent property, the question arises whether "instantaneous" is a well-defined concept at the fundamental quantum level.

An entangled system might be viewed as a composite object whose intrinsic timescale is determined by a combination of its components' masses. This could cast the apparent non-local "spooky action at a distance" in a new light.

\subsection{Consistent Formulation of a Mass-Dependent Time Theory}

To develop a fully consistent theory, we might reinterpret the Hamiltonian:
\[
\hat{H}' = \frac{mc^2}{\hbar} \hat{H}
\]

This would lead the modified Schrödinger equation to:
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi
\]

This returns to the original form but with a new interpretation: Time evolves at different "speeds" for various quantum objects depending on their mass, while relative energy levels and transitions remain preserved.

\subsection{Instantaneous Processes and Minimal Timescales}

A frequently overlooked issue in quantum mechanical interpretation is the assumption of absolute instantaneity. However, the characteristic timescale of a particle \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) establishes a fundamental minimal timescale. This implies that even processes considered "instantaneous" require at least a time on the order of \(T\).

Considering the energy-time uncertainty relation:
\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]
If \(\Delta E \sim mc^2\), it follows:
\[
\Delta t \gtrsim \frac{\hbar}{mc^2} = T
\]
This suggests that no information can be transmitted in exactly zero time—there exists a fundamental lower bound for any quantum interaction, derived directly from established principles.

\section{The Planck Mass as an Upper Limit and the Role of the Speed of Light}

\subsection{The Planck Mass as a Natural Limit}

In the preceding discussion, the intrinsic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) was introduced. We saw that a maximum mass \(m_{\text{max}}\) would lead to a minimum intrinsic time. This raises the question of whether there is a \textit{natural} upper limit to mass that can be derived from fundamental constants.

The \textit{Planck mass} \(m_P\) is precisely such a quantity. It is defined as:
\[
m_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.176 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{kg}
\]

The Planck mass arises \textit{directly} from the combination of three fundamental constants:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\hbar\): Reduced Planck constant (quantum of action, connecting energy and frequency).
	\item \(c\): Speed of light (fundamental speed limit, connecting space and time).
	\item \(G\): Gravitational constant (determines the strength of gravity).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpretation of the Planck Mass}

The Planck mass is often interpreted as the mass scale at which \textit{both} quantum effects \textit{and} strong gravitational effects become \textit{simultaneously} important:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Compton Wavelength = Schwarzschild Radius:} The Planck mass is the mass for which the Compton wavelength (\(\lambda_C = \frac{h}{mc}\), a measure of quantum uncertainty) is equal to the Schwarzschild radius (\(r_S = \frac{2Gm}{c^2}\), the radius within which an object collapses into a black hole).
	\item \textbf{Quantum Gravity:} The Planck mass marks a regime where we expect a theory of \textit{quantum gravity} to be necessary to describe physics correctly. General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) in their usual forms are no longer simultaneously valid at these energies/masses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planck Mass as an Upper Limit for Elementary Particles}

It is crucial to emphasize that the Planck mass is \textit{not} the maximum mass of any \textit{arbitrary} object in the universe. Stars, galaxies, and the entire universe can have masses that are \textit{many} orders of magnitude larger than the Planck mass.

However, the Planck mass \textit{is} a meaningful upper limit for the mass of \textit{elementary particles}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Elementary Particles and Black Holes:} An elementary particle with a mass \textit{greater} than the Planck mass, if compressed to within its Compton wavelength, would collapse into a black hole. It would therefore \textit{no longer} be an elementary particle.
	\item \textbf{Fundamental Limit:} The Planck mass thus represents a \textit{fundamental limit} on the mass of particles that we can still consider "point-like" (in the sense of elementary particles).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connection to the Speed of Light and Intrinsic Time}

The original motivation for considering a maximum mass came from the idea of a minimum intrinsic time in our theory.

The Planck mass is connected via the speed of light to a minimum time, the Planck time.

The derivation of the Planck mass from \(c\), \(\hbar\), and \(G\) demonstrates that the speed of light is \textit{essential} in defining this fundamental mass scale (and thus timescale).

\subsection{Relevance to the Extended QM with Intrinsic Time}

In our extended QM, where intrinsic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\) plays a role, the Planck mass has the following significance:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Minimum Time:} The Planck mass corresponds to the \textit{minimum} intrinsic time, the Planck time (\(t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s}\)).
	\item \textbf{Maximum Frequency/Energy:} It corresponds to the \textit{maximum} frequency (\(\nu_P = 1/t_P\)) and energy (\(E_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}}\)) that a single quantum can have.
\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Conclusion: Singularities Not Prevented}
	
	The Planck mass, as an upper limit for elementary particles, does \textit{not} prevent singularities in the classical sense:
	\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Black Holes:} Black holes are \textit{not} elementary particles. Their mass can be \textit{arbitrarily large}. The singularity at the \textit{center} of a black hole is a problem of GR that is \textit{not} "solved" by the Planck mass. The Planck mass becomes relevant for the \textit{quantum properties} of the black hole (e.g., Hawking radiation), but not for its overall mass.
\item \textbf{Big Bang:} The Planck mass and Planck time mark the boundary of our \textit{current understanding} of the early universe. They \textit{do not} imply that the universe \textit{could not} have originated from a state of even higher density and temperature. They simply indicate that we need a theory of quantum gravity to describe that phase.
\end{itemize}

So the Planck mass doesn't stop the formation of singularities implied by classical theories, but it does describe the area where the classical theory breaks down.

\subsection{Mass as a Boundary for Time Evolution in Quantum Mechanics}

In the special theory of relativity, the speed of light \(c\) serves as an upper bound for velocity, ensuring that no object with rest mass can exceed it due to the infinite energy required as \(v \to c\). Analogously, in this mass-dependent time theory, the mass \(m\) introduces boundaries for the intrinsic timescale \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\), constraining the dynamics of quantum systems.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Maximum Mass (\(m_{\text{max}}\)):} Similar to \(c\) as an upper limit for velocity, a maximum mass \(m_{\text{max}}\) bounds the timescale \(T\) from below. As \(m \to m_{\text{max}}\), \(T \to 0\), leading to an extremely rapid time evolution (maximal frequency \(\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h}\)). A natural candidate for \(m_{\text{max}}\) is the mass of the observable universe, approximately \(10^{53}\) kg, yielding:
\[
T_{\text{min}} = \frac{\hbar}{m_{\text{max}} c^2} \approx 1.17 \times 10^{-95} \, \text{s}.
\]
This represents the smallest physically meaningful timescale in the context of cosmological scales.

\item \textbf{Minimum Mass (\(m_{\text{min}}\)):} To prevent \(T\) from becoming infinite as \(m \to 0\), a minimum mass \(m_{\text{min}}\) is introduced. A plausible choice is the Planck mass, \(m_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \approx 2.2 \times 10^{-8}\) kg, at which:
\[
T_{\text{max}} = \frac{\hbar}{m_P c^2} \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s},
\]
corresponding to the Planck time. This sets an upper bound on \(T\), ensuring that time evolution remains finite and physically sensible.
\end{itemize}

To incorporate these boundaries, the time evolution in the Schrödinger equation can be adjusted as:
\[
i \max(m, m_{\text{min}}) c^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi, \quad m \leq m_{\text{max}}.
\]
This formulation ensures that \(T\) remains within the range \(10^{-95}\) s to \(10^{-44}\) s, providing a quantum mechanical analogue to the relativistic constraint imposed by \(c\). Unlike the Lorentz transformation, which features only an upper bound (\(c\)), this theory introduces both an upper and a lower mass limit, reflecting the dual nature of mass-dependent time evolution.

\appendix
\section{Discussion and Extensions: Natural Units and Implications for Quantum Mechanics}

This appendix discusses further questions and considerations related to the theory of mass-dependent time presented in the main text, particularly regarding the use of natural units and the consequences for quantum mechanics.

\subsection{Natural Units: \(c = \hbar = G = 1\)}

A central aspect of the theoretical considerations is the use of natural units, where the speed of light \(c\), the reduced Planck constant \(\hbar\), and the gravitational constant \(G\) are set to 1:
\[
c = \hbar = G = 1
\]

This choice significantly simplifies many equations and allows all physical quantities to be expressed in powers of a single fundamental unit (e.g., the Planck mass, Planck length, Planck time, or Planck energy).

\subsubsection{Impact on Mass}

In natural units, mass is expressed in units of the Planck mass \(m_P\). The Planck mass itself takes the value 1:
\[
m_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \xrightarrow{c=\hbar=G=1} 1
\]

The intrinsic time \(T\), introduced in the main text, simplifies to:
\[
T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2} \xrightarrow{c=\hbar=1} \frac{1}{m}
\]

This clarifies the inverse relationship between mass and intrinsic time: more massive objects have a shorter intrinsic time, and vice versa. A value of \(m = 2\) in this system means that the mass of the object is twice the Planck mass.

Furthermore, the minimum and maximum masses defined in the document are converted into relations. The maximum mass, the mass of the universe, is expressed relative to the Planck mass, and the minimum mass in this system is identical to the Planck mass:
\[
m_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{T_{\text{min}}}
\]
\[
m_{\text{min}} = m_P = 1
\]

\subsubsection{Significance for Interpretation}

The use of natural units emphasizes the fundamental role of the Planck mass as a natural unit scale in physics. It also underlines the interpretation of time proposed in the main text as an emergent property closely related to the mass (and thus energy) of the system under consideration.

\subsection{Implications for Quantum Mechanics}

The introduction of a mass-dependent intrinsic time, especially in the form \(T = 1/m\) (in natural units), has profound consequences for quantum mechanics.

\subsubsection{Reinterpretation of Time in the Schrödinger Equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mass-Specific Time Evolution:} The central idea is that time evolution in the Schrödinger equation is not universal but depends on the mass of the quantum system. More massive particles experience a "faster" time evolution (with respect to an external clock, but slower with respect to their own intrinsic time).
\item \textbf{Modified Schrödinger Equation:} The document proposes a modified form of the Schrödinger equation (Sections 4.2 and 7.7) to account for this dependence. Although the exact form and justification of the modification (particularly the role of the modified Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}'\)) require further investigation, the fundamental idea of a mass-dependent time is a crucial point.
\item \textbf{No External Time Parameter:} In contrast to traditional QM, where time \(t\) is an external parameter that is the same for all systems, time here becomes an intrinsic property of the system, determined by its mass.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact on Quantum Phenomena}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Coherence and Decoherence:} The mass-dependent time evolution has direct implications for coherence and decoherence (Section 7.2). Heavier systems should decohere differently than lighter ones, relative to their intrinsic time. This could be experimentally verifiable.
\item \textbf{Entanglement:} In entangled systems with particles of different masses, the time evolution of the components would be different, limited by the minimum time scale \(T\) derived from the energy-time uncertainty relation (Section 7.4). This could influence the interpretation of the EPR paradox and Bell's inequalities (Section 7.6).
\item \textbf{Quantum Interference:} The modified dispersion relation (Section 7.5) implies that the interference patterns of particles of different masses should differ, providing another experimental test possibility.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Connection to Relativity Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Emergent Time:} The idea that time is an emergent property arising from mass (energy) and the fundamental interactions is a step towards unifying quantum mechanics and relativity theory. Time is no longer considered an independent background.
\item \textbf{Analogy to Time Dilation:} The mass-dependent time evolution has similarities to relativistic time dilation, although it is derived from a different theoretical framework.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Open Questions and Challenges}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Consistency with Established QM:} It is crucial to show that the proposed theory is consistent with the experimentally well-confirmed predictions of standard quantum mechanics (e.g., the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom). Detailed calculations and comparisons with standard results are necessary.
\item \textbf{Relativistic Extension:} An extension of the theory to the relativistic domain (Dirac equation, quantum field theory) is necessary to obtain a complete and consistent picture. This represents a significant challenge.
\item \textbf{Experimental Verification:} The development of concrete, feasible experiments to test the specific predictions of the theory (e.g., differences in coherence times, modified dispersion relation) is of crucial importance to distinguish the theory from pure speculation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The mass-dependent intrinsic time in quantum mechanics discussed here, especially in the form \(T = 1/m\) in natural units, represents a profound reinterpretation of time. It connects time evolution directly to the mass of the quantum system and suggests a closer link between quantum mechanics and relativity theory. Although many questions remain open and considerable theoretical and experimental efforts are required, this approach offers a fascinating new perspective on the nature of time in the quantum world and its relationship to mass. The Planck mass plays a central role here, as the mass of the object under consideration, relative to it, enters into the equation for the intrinsic time.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}

The reformulation of Einstein's energy-mass equivalence to express time as a function of mass, the speed of light, and Planck's constant opens new conceptual perspectives. The further connection to the fine-structure constant illustrates how fundamental interactions might relate to the time evolution of quantum systems.

The mass-dependent time theory presented here challenges fundamental assumptions of quantum mechanics, particularly the notion of a uniform, universal time and instantaneous coherence across spatial distances. The intrinsic time \(T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}\), derived from \(E = mc^2\) and \(E = h\nu\), serves as a minimal timescale that constrains instantaneity, as confirmed by the energy-time uncertainty. This naturally links relativity, quantum mechanics, and the fine-structure constant, offering a novel approach to unifying these theories.

These ideas are speculative and require further theoretical development and experimental validation. However, they provide an intriguing starting point for discussions about the nature of time in quantum physics and could potentially lead to new insights into the connection between quantum mechanics and relativity.

Particularly promising is the possibility of devising experimental tests to distinguish between the conventional treatment of time and our mass-dependent approach. The predicted differences in coherence times, dispersion relations, and the dynamics of entangled systems with varying masses could yield experimentally verifiable signatures.
