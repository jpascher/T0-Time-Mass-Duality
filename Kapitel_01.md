THE VACUUM AS A DYNAMIC FIELD

In Dynamic Vacuum Field Theory (DVFT), and extended to T0-Theory, spacetime is no longer conceptualized as an empty geometric construct but rather as a physical medium governed by the intrinsic time-mass duality, described as:

\[ T(x,t) \cdot m(x,t) = 1 \]

This duality posits that changes in mass induce corresponding adjustments in time, ensuring that spacetime coherence is maintained.

The medium is further characterized by internal dynamical degrees of freedom and is modeled by a complex scalar field \(\Phi(x)\), which serves as the fundamental entity underlying both gravitational and quantum phenomena. The field is expressed in polar form as:

\[ 
\Phi(x) = \rho(x) e^{i\theta(x)} 
\]

Where:
- \(\Phi(x)\) is the dynamic vacuum field.
- \(\rho(x)\) signifies the vacuum amplitude.
- \(\theta(x)\) defines the vacuum phase, incorporating dynamic parametrizations.


The Parameter \( \xi = 4/3 \times 10^{-4} \): Through T0-theoretical calibration, the vacuum behaves not only as a reactive background but ensures conserved multi-dimensional spacetime mapped to evaluative units. ...
