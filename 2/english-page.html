        <h1>Overview of Publications on Time-Mass Duality</h1>
        <p>A Theoretical Framework for Extending Modern Physics</p>
    </header>

    <div class="abstract">
        <p>This overview presents a cohesive collection of works that develop a new theoretical framework for extending modern physics. At its center is the concept of time-mass duality, which proposes a fundamental reformulation of the relationship between time and mass. This approach not only offers a possible path toward unifying quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity, but also provides new perspectives on fundamental phenomena such as nonlocality, dark matter, and dark energy. The publications listed here form a coherent research program that ranges from theoretical foundations to concrete applications and experimentally verifiable predictions.</p>

                <p>This foundational work identifies critical conceptual limitations of existing quantum theories, particularly regarding the asymmetric treatment of time and space, and the static consideration of mass. It introduces the concept of intrinsic time T = ħ/mc² and develops an extended Lagrangian formalism that integrates time-mass duality into quantum field theory. A central aspect is the possibility of returning to a deterministic understanding of the quantum world through variable mass as a fundamental hidden variable, without conflicting with experimental findings.</p>

                <p>This work presents the two complementary perspectives that form the core of time-mass duality: the standard model with constant mass and variable time (time dilation) and the T₀ model with absolute time and variable mass. It demonstrates how these dual perspectives are mathematically interconvertible and can describe the same physical phenomena, albeit with different conceptual foundations. The paper develops the formal structure for transformation between both models and discusses the philosophical implications of this duality.</p>

                <p>This publication offers a comprehensive mathematical formulation of all four fundamental forces (gravitation, electromagnetic, strong, and weak force) within the framework of time-mass duality.

Special attention is given to modified gravitational theory and the reformulation of the standard model of particle physics, with the aim of achieving a coherent unification of all forces.</p>

                <p>This work extends the concept of time-mass duality to massless particles, particularly photons. By developing a dynamic mass concept for photons that correlates with their frequency, it offers a new perspective on phenomena such as quantum entanglement and nonlocality. It argues that the apparent instantaneous correlation of entangled photons can be explained through subtle, mass-dependent time structures without violating classical causality principles. The paper includes quantitative predictions for experimental tests of this hypothesis.</p>

                <p>This comprehensive work synthesizes the applications of the T₀ model to cosmological phenomena. It develops a theoretical framework that unifies cosmic expansion, the nature of dark energy, and galaxy dynamics in a coherent model. The central thesis is that systematic mass changes on cosmic scales can explain both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the observed anomalies in galaxy dynamics. The work quantifies the interaction between baryonic matter and the postulated dark energy field through the coupling parameter β ≈ 10⁻³.</p>

        <h2>Summary and Outlook</h2>
        <p>The presented publications together form a coherent research program that develops a fundamentally new approach to unifying and extending modern physics. Unlike other unifying approaches such as string theory or loop quantum gravity, which introduce complex additional structures, time-mass duality focuses on reformulating the most fundamental concepts—time and mass.</p>

        <p>The central idea of intrinsic time T = ħ/mc² and the complementary models (standard model and T₀ model) offers not only new theoretical perspectives but also concrete experimentally verifiable predictions. These include mass-dependent time evolution in quantum systems, subtle effects in entanglement experiments, and alternative understanding of cosmological phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy.</p>

        <p>Future research directions could include the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Development of detailed experimental protocols to verify mass-dependent time evolution</li>
            <li>Refinement of the mathematical formulation, particularly with regard to quantum gravitation</li>
            <li>Extended numerical simulations to verify modified galaxy dynamics</li>
            <li>Inclusion of additional fundamental particles and interactions in the theoretical framework</li>
            <li>Application of the theory to fundamental problems in quantum information and quantum computing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The overarching goal remains the development of a comprehensive, mathematically elegant, and experimentally confirmed "All-in-One" theory that unites quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity in a coherent framework while simultaneously addressing existing problems in modern physics such as nonlocality, dark matter, and dark energy.</p>
