\section*{Introduction}

This chapter explores What remains to be discovered in the context of the Fundamental Fractal-Geometric Field Theory. Building on our understanding from previous chapters (our already known concepts of tensors, metric tensor, and energy-momentum tensor), we delve deeper into this specific aspect of FFGFT.

\section{Main Concepts}

The philosophical implications of FFGFT are far-reaching. The time-mass duality challenges our conventional understanding of reality, suggesting that time and matter are not separate entities but different aspects of a unified geometric field.

\section{Connection to Fractal Geometry}

The fractal parameter $\xi = 4/3 \times 10^{-4}$ plays a crucial role in understanding these phenomena. The fractal dimension $D_f = 3 - \xi \approx 2.999867$ modifies the classical predictions and leads to new insights.

\section{Implications and Predictions}

The fractal structure of spacetime leads to testable predictions and explains observations that are puzzling in standard theories. The time-mass duality $T(x,t) \leftrightarrow m(x,t)$ provides a unified framework for understanding these phenomena.

\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we have seen how What remains to be discovered fits into the larger picture of FFGFT. Our central metaphor remains: the universe is like a brain with constant volume but increasing convolutions. Space doesn't expand – the fractal structure becomes more complex.

The next chapters will build on these insights to explore further aspects of the theory.
