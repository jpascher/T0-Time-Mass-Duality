	\section{Quantum Bits, Schrödinger Equation and Dirac Equation in T0}
	
	
    \subsection*{Narrative Introduction: The Cosmic Brain in Detail}
    
    We continue our journey through the cosmic brain. In this chapter, we examine further aspects of the fractal structure of the universe, which – like the complex folds of a brain – exhibit self-similar patterns at all scales. What at first glance appears as isolated physical phenomena reveals itself upon closer examination as the expression of a unified geometric principle: the fractal packing with parameter $\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}$.
    
    Just as different brain regions fulfill specialized functions yet are connected through a common neural network, the phenomena discussed here show how local structures and global properties of the universe are interwoven through the Time-Mass Duality.
    
    \subsection*{The Mathematical Foundation}
    
	T0-Time-Mass Duality interprets quantum phenomena not as separate postulates, but as emergent consequences of fractal vacuum dynamics. Quantum bits (qubits), the Schrödinger equation and the Dirac equation are uniformly derived from the vacuum field \(\Phi = \rho \, e^{i\theta}\) with the single parameter \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\), consistent with Time-Mass Duality and fractal geometry. This chapter integrates the simplified representation of the Dirac equation as field node dynamics, which reduces the complex matrix structure to simple field excitations, considering the geometric foundations and natural units.
	
	\subsection{Quantum Bits as Vacuum Phase States}
	
	In quantum information science, a qubit is a state in two-dimensional Hilbert space:
	\begin{equation}
		|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle, \quad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(|\psi\rangle\): Qubit state (dimensionless, as vector in Hilbert space),
		\item \(\alpha, \beta\): Complex amplitudes (dimensionless, with normalization condition),
		\item \(|0\rangle, |1\rangle\): Basis states (dimensionless).
	\end{itemize}
	
	In T0, a qubit is a stable phase configuration of the vacuum field:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta_{\text{qubit}} = \theta_0 + \xi \cdot (\phi_0 |0\rangle + \phi_1 |1\rangle),
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\theta_{\text{qubit}}\): Phase configuration for the qubit (dimensionless),
		\item \(\theta_0\): Global vacuum phase (dimensionless),
		\item \(\phi_0, \phi_1\): Fractally scaled phase angles (dimensionless),
		\item \(\xi\): Fractal scale parameter (dimensionless, value \(\frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	Superposition emerges from the global coherence of the vacuum phase \(\theta\), regulated by fractal self-similarity \(\xi\). The Bloch sphere arises from the cylindrical geometry of the complex field (\(\rho\) as radius, \(\theta\) as angle):
	\begin{equation}
		|\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\vartheta}{2}\right) |0\rangle + e^{i\varphi} \sin\left(\frac{\vartheta}{2}\right) |1\rangle,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\vartheta\): Polar angle (dimensionless, \(\propto \xi \cdot \Delta \rho\)),
		\item \(\varphi\): Azimuthal angle (dimensionless, \(\propto \Delta \theta\)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	Qubit gates like the Hadamard gate are phase rotations:
	\begin{equation}
		H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \Delta \theta = \frac{\pi}{\xi^{1/2}},
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(H\): Hadamard matrix (dimensionless),
		\item \(\Delta \theta\): Phase shift (dimensionless).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The derivation is based on the variation of the fractal action, where \(\xi\) determines the coherence length. T0 predicts robust qubits at room temperature through stable phase configurations.
	
	Validation: In the limit \(\xi \to 0\), the qubit reduces to classical bits, consistent with macroscopic physics.
	
	\subsection{Derivation of Schrödinger Equation from T0}
	
	The Schrödinger equation
	\begin{equation}
		i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi
	\end{equation}
	emerges in T0 from the phase dynamics of the vacuum field.
	
	The T0 vacuum field \(\Phi = \rho \, e^{i\theta}\) obeys the fractal wave equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\square \Phi + \xi \cdot B (\nabla \theta)^2 \Phi = 0,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\square\): D'Alembertian operator (unit: m$^{-2}$ or s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(\Phi\): Vacuum field (dimensionless),
		\item \(B\): Phase stiffness (unit: kg\,m$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(\nabla \theta\): Phase gradient (dimensionless per m),
		\item \(\xi\): Fractal scale parameter (dimensionless).
	\end{itemize}
	
	In the non-relativistic limit one separates:
	\begin{equation}
		\psi = e^{i \theta / \xi}, \quad \rho \approx \rho_0 + \delta \rho.
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\psi\): Wave function (dimensionless),
		\item \(\rho_0\): Vacuum fundamental density (unit: kg/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(\delta \rho\): Density deviation (unit: kg/m$^{3}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The variation leads to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with fractal term:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} + \frac{(\nabla \theta)^2}{2m} + V + \xi \cdot \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\nabla^2 \sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{\rho}} = 0,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\theta\): Phase (dimensionless),
		\item \(m\): Mass (unit: kg),
		\item \(V\): Potential (unit: J),
		\item \(\hbar\): Reduced Planck constant (unit: J\,s).
	\end{itemize}
	
	With Madelung transformation follows the Schrödinger equation, where the fractal term regularizes divergences.
	
	Validation: In the limit \(\xi \to 0\) reduces to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
	
	\subsection{Derivation of Dirac Equation from T0}
	
	The Dirac equation
	\begin{equation}
		i \hbar \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi - m c \psi = 0
	\end{equation}
	emerges in T0 from multi-component vacuum fields, but is simplified to field node dynamics.
	
	In the detailed T0 integration (natural units \(\hbar = c = 1\)), the modified Dirac equation becomes:
	\begin{equation}
		i\gamma^{\mu}(\partial_{\mu} + \Gamma_{\mu}^{(T)}) \psi - m(\vec{x},t) \psi = 0,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\gamma^\mu\): Dirac matrices (dimensionless),
		\item \(\partial_\mu\): Partial derivative operator (unit: m$^{-1}$ or s$^{-1}$),
		\item \(\Gamma_{\mu}^{(T)}\): Time-field connection (unit: m$^{-1}$ or s$^{-1}$, \(\Gamma_{\mu}^{(T)} = -\frac{\partial_{\mu} m}{m^2}\)),
		\item \(m(\vec{x},t)\): Local mass density (unit: kg/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(\psi\): Dirac spinor (dimensionless).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The derivation is based on Time-Mass Duality \(T \cdot m = 1\), with \(T\): time field (unit: s/m$^{3}$), and fractal geometry \(\beta = 2Gm/r\) (dimensionless), \(\xi = 2\sqrt{G} \cdot m\) (dimensionless).
	
	Validation: In the weak field limit (\(\beta \ll 1\)) reduces to the standard Dirac equation, consistent with QED precision measurements (e.g., g-2 of the electron).
	
	\subsubsection{Simplified Dirac Equation as Field Node Dynamics}
	
	In the simplified T0 view, the Dirac equation reduces to:
	\begin{equation}
		\square \delta m = 0,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\square\): D'Alembertian operator (unit: m$^{-2}$ or s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(\delta m\): Field node amplitude (unit: kg/m$^{3}$, as density deviation from vacuum ground \(\rho_0\)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The spinor \(\psi\) becomes a node pattern:
	\begin{equation}
		\psi(x,t) \to \delta m_{\text{fermion}}(x,t) = \delta m_0 \cdot f_{\text{spin}}(x,t),
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\delta m_0\): Node amplitude (unit: kg/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(f_{\text{spin}}(x,t)\): Spin structure function (dimensionless, \(f_{\text{spin}} = A \cdot e^{i(\vec{k} \cdot \vec{x} - \omega t + \phi_{\text{spin}})}\)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	Spin-1/2 emerges from node rotation with frequency \(\omega_{\text{spin}} \propto m c^2 / \hbar \cdot \xi\).
	
	The Lagrangian density simplifies to:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L} = \varepsilon \cdot (\partial \delta m)^2,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\mathcal{L}\): Lagrangian density (unit: J/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(\varepsilon\): Node energy coefficient (unit: J\,s$^{2}$/kg$^{2}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	Validation: Yields the same predictions for g-2 (e.g., electron: \(\sim 2 \times 10^{-10}\)), but with simple interpretation: fermions as rotating nodes, bosons as extended excitations.
	
	\subsection{Comparison with Standard Interpretations}
	
	\begin{table}[h]

		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Comparison of standard QM and T0.}
	\end{table}
	
	T0 solves paradoxes through deterministic node dynamics, consistent with Time-Mass Duality.
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	
	Quantum bits, Schrödinger and Dirac equations emerge in T0 parameter-free from fractal vacuum dynamics with \(\xi\). The simplified Dirac equation as field nodes reduces complexity to simple excitations, unifies fermions and bosons and resolves dualities – an inevitable consequence of the vacuum substrate in FFGFT.
	

    
    \subsection*{Narrative Summary: Understanding the Brain}
    
    What we have seen in this chapter is more than a collection of mathematical formulas – it is a window into the functioning of the cosmic brain. Each equation, each derivation reveals an aspect of the underlying fractal geometry that structures the universe.
    
    Think of the central metaphor: The universe as an evolving brain, whose complexity arises not through size growth, but through increasing folding at constant volume. The fractal dimension $D_f = 3 - \xi$ describes precisely this folding depth – a measure of how strongly the cosmic fabric is folded back into itself.
    
    The results presented here are not isolated facts, but puzzle pieces of a larger picture: a reality in which time and mass are dual to each other, in which space is not fundamental but emerges from the activity of a fractal vacuum, and in which all observable phenomena follow from a single geometric parameter $\xi$.
    
    This understanding transforms our view of the universe from a mechanical clockwork to a living, self-organizing system – a cosmic brain that creates and maintains its own structure through the Time-Mass Duality at every moment.
