\section*{Chapter 43: Fundamental Axioms and Constants in Fractal T0 Geometry}
	
	\subsection*{Brief Introduction}
	
	This chapter formulates the fundamental axioms of the FFGFT and shows how all constants emerge from the single parameter \(\xi\).
	
	\subsection*{Mathematical Foundation}
	
	The FFGFT is based on a few axioms about the vacuum field \(\Phi = \rho e^{i\theta}\). All physical constants and laws follow from it, with \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\).
	
	\subsection*{Axiom 1: Complex Vacuum Field}
	
	The universe is described by a complex scalar field \(\Phi = \rho e^{i\theta}\), where \(\rho\) is the amplitude (mass density) and \(\theta\) is the phase (time density).
	
	\subsection*{Axiom 2: Fractal Self-Similarity}
	
	The field is self-similar with scaling parameter \(\xi\), leading to logarithmic correlations.
	
	\subsection*{Axiom 3: Time-Mass Duality}
	
	\begin{equation}
		T(x,t) \cdot m(x,t) = 1.
	\end{equation}
	
	Time density \(T\) and mass density \(m\) are inverse — fundamental symmetry (constant normalised to 1).
	
	\subsection*{Emergence of Constants}
	
	Light speed as maximum propagation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		c = \frac{l_0}{t_0} \cdot \xi^{-1/2}.
	\end{equation}
	
	Planck constant from phase quantisation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\hbar = \rho_0 l_0^3 \cdot \xi.
	\end{equation}
	
	Gravity:
	
	\begin{equation}
		G = \frac{\hbar c}{\rho_0^2 l_0^4} \cdot \xi^3.
	\end{equation}
	
	All constants reduce to \(\xi\), \(l_0\), \(\rho_0\).
	
	\subsection*{Comparison with Standard Model}

			\textbf{Standard Model} & \textbf{FFGFT (T0)} \\
			\hline
			19+ free parameters & One parameter \(\xi\) \\
			Postulates & Axioms + emergence \\
			No unification & Complete \\
			Arbitrary constants & Geometrically derived \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection*{Conclusion}
	
	The FFGFT is based on three axioms: complex vacuum field, fractal self-similarity, Time-Mass Duality. All physical constants and laws emerge from the single parameter \(\xi\) — a minimalist, unified theory of nature.
