\section*{Particle Mass Hierarchy and Weakness of Gravity in Fractal T0 Geometry}
	
	\subsection*{Brief Introduction}
	
	This chapter explains the enormous range of particle masses and the extreme weakness of gravity as dual consequences of the fractal vacuum structure.
	
	\subsection*{Mathematical Foundation}
	
	Two central puzzles in physics are the mass hierarchy (from neutrinos to the top quark spanning 14 orders of magnitude) and the weakness of gravity (approximately \(10^{32}\) times weaker than the weak force). In the FFGFT, both arise from the amplitude-phase separation of the vacuum field \(\Phi = \rho e^{i\theta}\), regulated by \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\).
	

	
	\subsection*{Vacuum Stiffness as the Cause of Gravitational Weakness}
	
	The vacuum stiffness determines the strength of gravity:
	
	\begin{equation}
		B = \rho_0^2 \xi^{-2}.
	\end{equation}
	
	The equilibrium density \(\rho_0\) sets the fundamental energy scale, while \(\xi^{-2} \approx 5.625 \times 10^6\) amplifies it enormously because the fractal structure makes the vacuum extremely stiff — small deformations cost a lot of energy. Gravity acts as a weak deformation of the amplitude \(\delta \rho\), hence it is weakened by the factor \(\xi^2\) compared to other forces that couple directly to the phase \(\theta\).
	
	\textbf{Unit check:}
	
	\begin{equation}
		[B] = (\si{kg^{1/2}/m^{3/2}})^2 = \si{J}.
	\end{equation}
	
	The weakness factor:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{G}{g_w^2} \approx \xi^2 \approx 1.78 \times 10^{-7},
	\end{equation}
	
	which is consistent with the observed hierarchy of \(10^{-32}\) (including mass scales) when considering the different coupling mechanisms.
	
	\subsection*{Mass Hierarchy from Phase Modes}
	
	Particle masses arise from stable phase configurations:
	
	\begin{equation}
		m_i = m_0 \cdot (1 - \cos(\theta_i)).
	\end{equation}
	
	The cosine term describes the deviation of the phase \(\theta_i\) from the minimum (where \(m_i = 0\)). Small \(\theta_i\) yield small masses (neutrinos), large \(\theta_i\) large masses (top quark). The fractal hierarchy distributes the \(\theta_i\) logarithmically:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\theta_i \approx \xi \cdot \ln(i + 1).
	\end{equation}
	
	The logarithm sums over generations, \(\xi\) damps each level — hence an exponential hierarchy.
	
	\textbf{Unit check:}
	
	\begin{equation}
		[m_i] = \si{kg}.
	\end{equation}
	
	The span:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{m_t}{m_\nu} \approx \xi^{-12} \approx 10^{14},
	\end{equation}
	
	since 12 fractal levels (three generations × four forces) amplify the suppression.
	
	\subsection*{Amplitude Deformation as Gravity}
	
	Gravity acts through:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\delta \rho = \xi^2 \cdot \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2} \cdot \rho_0.
	\end{equation}
	
	The double \(\xi^2\) suppression makes the deformation extremely weak, while other forces couple directly to \(\theta\) and are therefore stronger.
	
	\subsection*{Comparison with Other Approaches}

	\subsection*{Conclusion}
	
	The FFGFT explains the mass hierarchy and gravitational weakness as dual effects of the amplitude-phase separation with stiffness ratio from \(\xi\). From neutrino masses (\(\sim \SI{0.01}{eV/c^{2}}\)) to the top quark (\(\SI{173}{GeV/c^{2}}\)) — everything is a geometric consequence of the fractal Time-Mass Duality.
