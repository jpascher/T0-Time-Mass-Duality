\chapter{The Neutrino Mass Problem in Fractal T0 Geometry}


\section{Brief Introduction}



This chapter resolves the open questions regarding neutrino masses — their smallness, the three generations, hierarchy, mixing, and Majorana nature — through pure phase excitations of the vacuum field.

\subsection*{Mathematical Foundation}

In the FFGFT, neutrinos are not Dirac or Majorana fields with amplitude but pure phase excitations of the vacuum field \(\Phi = \rho(x,t) e^{i\theta(x,t)}\). All properties emerge from the fundamental parameter \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\).

\subsection*{Neutrinos as Pure Phase Excitations}

Neutrinos have almost no amplitude component — their mass arises solely from phase windings. The minimal stable phase shift is limited by fractal fluctuations:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta \theta_{\min} \approx \xi^{3/2} \cdot \sqrt{\ln(\xi^{-1})}.
\end{equation}

The term \(\xi^{3/2}\) comes from the triple hierarchy of fractal scaling, the logarithm from resummation over infinitely many levels. This small shift makes neutrinos almost massless compared to charged leptons.

\subsection*{Mass Hierarchy of the Three Generations}

The masses result from trigonometric projections of 120°-offset phases:

\begin{equation}
	m_1 \approx 2 m_0^\nu \cdot \sin^2(\theta_0 / 2),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	m_2 \approx 2 m_0^\nu \cdot \sin^2((\theta_0 + 120^\circ)/2),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	m_3 \approx 2 m_0^\nu \cdot \sin^2((\theta_0 + 240^\circ)/2).
\end{equation}

The factor \(2 m_0^\nu\) sets the overall scale, the squared sine describes the effective mass from the phase deviation from equilibrium. The 120° offset is the natural symmetry of the three fractal generations.

With a small fractal correction \(\theta_0 \approx \pi + \xi \cdot \Delta\), the observed hierarchy emerges:

\begin{equation}
	m_1 : m_2 : m_3 \approx 1 : 3 : 8
\end{equation}

in first order — consistent with the normal hierarchy.

The absolute scale:

\begin{equation}
	m_0^\nu \approx \frac{\hbar}{c l_0} \cdot \xi^3 \approx \SI{0.05}{\eV}.
\end{equation}

The factor \(\xi^3\) arises from the triple fractal suppression of the phase-amplitude coupling.

The sum of the masses:

\begin{equation}
	\sum m_\nu \approx \SI{0.12}{\eV}
\end{equation}

lies within the cosmologically allowed range.

\textbf{Unit check:}
\[
[m_0^\nu] = \si{\joule\second} / (\si{\meter\per\second} \cdot \si{\meter}) = \si{\kilo\gram} \quad (\text{converted to eV}).
\]

\subsection*{PMNS Mixing from Phase Overlap}

The mixing matrix arises from the overlap of adjacent phase modes:

\begin{equation}
	U_{ij} \approx \cos(\Delta \theta_{ij}) + i \xi \cdot \sin(\Delta \theta_{ij}).
\end{equation}

The cosine term gives the main mixing (tribimaximal), the imaginary \(\xi\) term small perturbations — exactly the observed PMNS structure with large mixing angles.

\subsection*{Majorana Nature}

Since neutrinos are pure phases, charge conjugation is equivalent to phase reversal \(\theta \to -\theta\):

\begin{equation}
	\nu = \nu^c.
\end{equation}

They are necessarily Majorana particles.

		\textbf{Standard Model} & \textbf{FFGFT (T0)} \\
		\hline
		Masses ad-hoc & Emergent from phase \\
		Seesaw postulated & No amplitude \\
		Three generations arbitrary & 120° symmetry \\
		PMNS free & From phase overlap \\
		Majorana unclear & Necessarily Majorana \\

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The FFGFT completely resolves the neutrino problem: small masses from pure phase, three generations from fractal 120° symmetry, hierarchy and mixing from \(\xi\)-perturbations, Majorana nature from self-conjugation. All values emerge naturally from the single parameter \(\xi\), elegantly closing the lepton sector.
