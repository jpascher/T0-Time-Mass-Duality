\section*{Entropy and the Second Law in Fractal T0 Geometry}
	
	\subsection*{Brief Introduction}
	
	This chapter derives entropy and the second law from the fractal phase uncertainty of the vacuum field — the arrow of time emerges geometrically.
	
	\subsection*{Mathematical Foundation}
	
	The second law states increasing entropy. In the FFGFT, entropy is the logarithmic phase uncertainty of the vacuum field \(\theta(x,t)\), regulated by \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\). There is no instantaneous action — the arrow arises from the increasing fragmentation of the vacuum structure.
	
	\subsection*{Entropy as Phase Uncertainty}
	
	Entropy is defined as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		S = k_B \ln(\Delta \theta / \delta \theta_{\min}),
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\Delta \theta\) is the total phase uncertainty and \(\delta \theta_{\min} \approx \xi^{3/2}\) the minimal fractal uncertainty. The Boltzmann constant \(k_B\) sets the scale.
	
	\textbf{Unit check:}
	
	\begin{equation}
		[S] = \si{J/K}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection*{Increasing Fragmentation of the Vacuum Structure}
	
	What is interpreted as the expansion of the universe in the classical picture is, in the FFGFT, an increasing fragmentation of the vacuum structure — fractal coherence decreases, the number of independent phase modes increases. This leads to growing phase uncertainty:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta F(t) \approx \xi \cdot \ln(V(t)/V_0),
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\Delta F\) measures the fragmentation and \(V(t)\) the effective volume of independent regions. The larger \(V(t)\), the more fragmented the structure, the higher the entropy.
	
	\subsection*{Second Law}
	
	The rate:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{dS}{dt} = k_B N \cdot \frac{\xi}{2 \sqrt{\Delta F(t)}} \cdot \frac{d(\Delta F)}{dt} > 0.
	\end{equation}
	
	Positive due to increasing fragmentation — arrow of time geometric.
	
	\subsection*{Thermodynamic Relations}
	
	Temperature:
	
	\begin{equation}
		T = \frac{\rho V}{S / k_B}.
	\end{equation}
	
	Consistent with radiation and matter.
	
	\subsection*{Comparison Standard – FFGFT}
	
	\begin{center}

			\textbf{Standard} & \textbf{FFGFT (T0)} \\
			\hline
			Entropy postulated & From phase uncertainty \\
			Arrow of time ad-hoc & From fragmentation \\
			Statistical & Geometric \\
			No micro-foundation & Fractal vacuum \\

	\subsection*{Conclusion}
	
	The FFGFT derives entropy and the second law from growing phase uncertainty and fragmentation of the vacuum structure. The arrow of time is a geometric consequence of the fractal structure — everything parameter-free from \(\xi\).
