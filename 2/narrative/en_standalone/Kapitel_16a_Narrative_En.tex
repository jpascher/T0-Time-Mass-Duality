	\section*{Introduction}
	
	We continue our journey through the cosmic brain. In this chapter, we examine the so-called Hubble tension—the apparent discrepancy of approximately 8\% between the Hubble constant measured from the early universe (CMB data) and that obtained from the local universe (Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae).
	
	In the Standard Model, this tension represents a problem because the cosmological constant is rigid and cannot produce two different values for $H_0$. In FFGFT, the tension is **naturally explained**: The vacuum field is dynamic, and its amplitude responds differently to the homogeneous structure of the early universe and to the fractal structure formation in the late universe.
	
	The tension arises as a backreaction effect of fractal deepening—the cosmic brain has developed more convolutions in the local region, slightly increasing the effective expansion rate.
	
	\section*{The Mathematical Foundation – Modified Friedmann Equation}
	
	The modified Friedmann equation in fractal T0 geometry reads:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			H^2(a) &= H_0^2 \Biggl[ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_r a^{-4} \\
			&\quad + \Omega_\xi \left(1 + \xi \ln\left(\frac{a}{a_{\text{eq}}}\right) 
			\cdot \left(1 + \xi^{1/2} \frac{\delta \rho_m(a)}{\rho_m(a)}\right) \right) \Biggr]
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	
	where $a$ is the scale factor. The additional term $\xi \ln(a)$ arises from the fractal deepening over time — the effective dimension decreases slightly as structures form, accelerating the apparent expansion locally.
	
	\textbf{Unit check:}
	
	\begin{equation}
		[H(a)] = \si{1/s}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\section*{Derivation of the Fractal Friedmann Equation}
	
	The standard Friedmann equation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k c^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}.
	\end{equation}
	
	In the FFGFT, the density $\rho$ is fractally modified:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\rho_{\text{eff}} = \rho \cdot (1 - \xi \ln(a)).
	\end{equation}
	
	The logarithmic term accounts for the increasing fractal “roughness” — effective density decreases as the universe expands and structures fragment. This yields the modified Hubble rate with an effective time-dependent $\Lambda$.
	
	\section*{Numerical Resolution of the Tension}
	
	The local value (late times, $a \approx 1$):
	
	\begin{equation}
		H_0^{\text{local}} = H_0^{\text{early}} \sqrt{1 + \xi \ln(1/a_{\text{recomb}})} \approx H_0^{\text{early}} \cdot 1.08,
	\end{equation}
	
	with recombination at $a_{\text{recomb}} \approx 10^{-3}$. The factor $\ln(1/a_{\text{recomb}}) \approx 6.9$, scaled by $\xi \approx 10^{-4}$, gives exactly the observed 8\% discrepancy — parameter-free.
	
	For local density contrasts $\langle \delta \rho_m / \rho_{\text{crit}} \rangle \approx 3$ (local overdensities in filaments and voids), we obtain:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\Delta H_0}{H_0} \approx 0.0205 \cdot 3 + \mathcal{O}(\xi) \approx 0.0615 + 0.02 \approx 8\%.
	\end{equation}
	
	\section*{Validation in the Limiting Case}
	
	In the limit $\xi \to 0$ (no fractal dynamics), the equation reduces exactly to the standard Friedmann equation of $\Lambda$CDM—consistent with early-universe data (CMB). The deviation grows with structure formation ($a \to 1$), explaining the higher local measurement.
	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	The Fundamental Fractal Geometric Field Theory (FFGFT) resolves the Hubble tension in a parameter-free and mathematically precise manner as a direct consequence of the dynamic fractal vacuum structure and the Time-Mass Duality. The apparent discrepancy is neither a measurement error nor new physics beyond the vacuum, but rather the natural effect of fractal deepening ($D_f = 3 - \xi(t)$) in the local universe.
	
	In contrast to $\Lambda$CDM, which assumes a rigid dark energy, the slow variation of $\xi(t)$ produces an effective time dependence of the vacuum energy that precisely accounts for the observed 8\% tension—yet another confirmation of the single fundamental parameter $\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}$.
	
	The cosmic brain has developed more convolutions in the local region—the expansion appears faster because the structure has become more complex.
