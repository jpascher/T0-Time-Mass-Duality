		In the paper \emph{``A GHZ-type Paradox in a High-Dimensional Quantum System''} \cite{ScienceAdvances}, a GHZ-type paradox is demonstrated in a 37-dimensional Hilbert space. Although the theoretical framework assumes a perfect, linear, unitary evolution of quantum states, the experimental implementation relies on continuously modulated control pulses. This document argues that the redundant measurement outcomes observed in such high-dimensional systems indicate the presence of internal intermodulation effects at the atomic level—effects that are not fully captured by the idealized unitary model even when external disturbances are minimized. In addition, the intrinsic coupling of atomic degrees of freedom, often represented in models by coupling factors, is discussed to further elucidate the limitations of a purely unitary description.

	\section{Introduction}
	The standard formulation of quantum mechanics describes the evolution of an isolated system by a unitary operator acting on its state vector:
	\[
	|\psi(t)\rangle = U(t,t_0)|\psi(t_0)\rangle,
	\]
	with \(U(t,t_0)\) being a perfectly linear, norm-preserving operator. This idealized evolution underpins many theoretical results, such as proofs of contextuality via GHZ-type paradoxes. The paper under discussion realizes such a paradox in a 37-dimensional Hilbert space using a prepare-and-measure scheme that employs time-multiplexed, modulated pulses and homodyne detection.
	
	\section{Experimental Realization and Theoretical Framework}
	The paper emphasizes that the GHZ-type paradox is implemented in a 37-dimensional system, where the exclusivity of measurement events is represented using graph-theoretic methods (for instance, through the Perkel graph). The experiment employs high-speed modulated pulses to encode and retrieve the full complex amplitude (both magnitude and phase) of pulsed coherent light. The analysis is based on the assumption of an idealized, unitary, linear evolution of the quantum state, even though the physical realization involves continuously modulated control pulses.
	
	\section{Internal Modulation Effects and Coupling in Atomic Systems}
	It is crucial to recognize that the issue is not merely an abstract philosophical question about whether unitary operations exist solely as a mathematical ideal. Rather, it concerns the concrete physical reality that even at the atomic level, degrees of freedom invariably interact and influence each other. Atoms are not isolated, indivisible units; they are complex systems with internal degrees of freedom—such as electronic states, nuclear spins, and vibrational modes—that are constantly interacting. These interactions are fundamental to the properties of matter and to the behavior of quantum systems.
	
	For example, the electromagnetic interaction is the dominant force that couples atomic degrees of freedom. Electrons in an atom interact both with each other and with the nucleus via electromagnetic forces, and similar interactions occur between different atoms or molecules (e.g., through van der Waals forces or chemical bonds). In multi-particle systems, spin-spin interactions—mediated by dipole-dipole or exchange mechanisms—also play a significant role. In molecules, vibrational and rotational modes are coupled such that an excitation in one mode can influence the other. Moreover, atoms and molecules are continuously coupled to the surrounding electromagnetic field, even in a vacuum where fluctuations occur.
	
	Many theoretical models account for these mutual influences by introducing coupling factors—parameters that quantify the strength of interactions between different degrees of freedom. For instance, in describing the interaction of a two-level atom with a laser field, the Rabi frequency serves as a coupling factor that depends on both the amplitude of the laser field and the dipole moment of the atomic transition. Similarly, spin models employ coupling constants (such as \(J\) or \(D\)) to describe the interaction strength between neighboring spins, and molecular vibration models include anharmonicity constants to capture deviations from an ideal harmonic oscillator. The use of coupling factors allows complex interactions to be parametrized and quantitatively described, thereby enabling predictions about the behavior of coupled systems and the interpretation of experimental data.
	
	\section{Implications for Unitary Evolution and Internal Modulation Effects}
	The recognition of these atomic couplings has significant implications for the concept of unitary evolution. While the overall coupled system evolves unitarily, the projection of this evolution onto a single degree of freedom is generally not unitary. The coupling between degrees of freedom leads to more complex dynamics, including nonlinear behavior, chaotic dynamics, emergent phenomena, and intermodulation effects. These aspects are not captured by simple models that consider only isolated degrees of freedom.
	
	In systems where control pulses are continuously modulated, the interplay between internal interactions (as described by coupling factors) and the external modulation of the control signals can lead to intermodulation effects. Such effects manifest as redundant or unexpected correlations in measurement outcomes, deviating from the predictions of an ideal unitary model. Although many models incorporate coupling factors as approximations, the true nature of atomic interactions can involve higher-order terms, nonlinearities, and environmental influences that are not fully captured by simplified theoretical descriptions.
	
	\section{Photonic Systems and Coupling Effects}
	In contrast to atoms, photons do not possess the complex internal structure—such as electronic, vibrational, or spin degrees of freedom—that gives rise to intrinsic coupling effects. Thus, they do not inherently exhibit the same type of internal intermodulation effects observed in atomic systems. However, in photonic experiments like the one discussed, the experimental setup (which includes optical fibers, modulators, and interferometric detection) can introduce effective coupling effects. These arise from optical nonlinearities, dispersion, or technical imperfections in the optical components and signal processing. Therefore, while the inherent atomic coupling is absent in photons, the practical implementation of a high-dimensional photonic system may still be influenced by analogous extrinsic effects due to the apparatus and the continuous modulation techniques employed.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	The experimental realization of a GHZ-type paradox in a 37-dimensional system, as presented in \cite{ScienceAdvances}, offers compelling evidence of quantum contextuality. However, the redundant measurement outcomes observed suggest that internal intermodulation effects—arising from the continuous modulation of control pulses and the intrinsic coupling of atomic degrees of freedom—play a significant role. Moreover, while photons do not exhibit the same intrinsic coupling as atoms, extrinsic, apparatus-induced effects can still influence the measurements. This discrepancy between the idealized unitary model and the physical reality underscores the need for more realistic models that explicitly incorporate these subtle internal processes. A comprehensive understanding of high-dimensional quantum systems will require integrating these effects into the traditional theoretical framework.
