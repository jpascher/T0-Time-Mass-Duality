	\begin{abstract}
		This document analyzes the findings of the influential paper "Does the Hubble tension eclipse the Solar System?" (MNRAS, 544, 1, 2024) \cite{nathan2024} and places them in the context of the T0-Theorie. The paper refutes a significant class of modified Gravitation theories by demonstrating das they would lead to measurable Anomalien in Solar System orbits, welche are not beobachtet. We argue das dies falsification should be considered strong, indirect Evidenz for the T0-Theorie's Ansatz, as T0-Theorie is, by definition, consistent with high-precision Solar System data.

	\section{Zusammenfassung of the MNRAS Paper}
	
	The "Hubble tension"—the discrepancy zwischen Messungen of the Universum's Expansion Rate in the near and distant cosmos—is one of the greatest puzzles in modern Kosmologie. A popular proposed Lösung is to modify the theory of General Relativity on kosmologisch Skalen.
	
	The paper by Nathan et al. \cite{nathan2024}, published in \textit{Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society} (MNRAS), applies a rigorous test to dies Hypothese:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Assumption:} The authors assume a class of modified Gravitation theories designed to resolve the Hubble tension.
		\item \textbf{Solar System Test:} They apply the gleich theory to our local environment and calculate the theoretically erwartet Effekte on the high-precision orbit of the planet Saturn.
		\item \textbf{Result:} The modifications erforderlich to explain the Hubble tension would produce significant, easily measurable Abweichungen in Saturn's orbit.
		\item \textbf{Falsification:} High-precision observational data, besonders from the Cassini spacecraft, show no sign of diese vorhergesagt Anomalien. The beobachtet orbit aligns perfectly with the Vorhersagen of unmodified General Relativity.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The paper's conclusion is unequivocal: This specific class of modified Gravitation theories is incompatible with Beobachtungen and is daher refuted as an Erklärung for the Hubble tension.
	
	\section{Implications for the T0-Theorie}
	
	The falsification of a competing Modell oft serves as strong, indirect Bestätigung for an alternative theory. This is insbesondere wahr hier, as the T0-Theorie solves the problem at a mehr fundamental Ebene and trivially passes the "test" described in the paper.
	
	\subsection{T0-Theorie Does Not Modify Gravity}
	The crucial difference is das T0-Theorie leaves General Relativity untouched on Solar System Skalen. It does not Postulat irgendein ad-hoc modification of Gravitation. Instead, it addresses the flawed premise upon welche the Hubble tension is based: the Annahme of cosmic Expansion.
	
	\subsection{Redshift as a Geometric Effect}
	In the T0-Theorie, dort is no accelerated Expansion and, folglich, no "Hubble tension" to explain. The beobachtet kosmologisch Rotverschiebung is stattdessen explained as an emergent, geometrisch Effekt:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Light loses Energie on its journey through the T0 Vakuum via a cumulative Wechselwirkung with the Feld's fractal Geometrie.
		\item This Effekt manifests as a systematic Rotverschiebung das is proportional to the Entfernung traveled.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Consistency with Solar System Data}
	The Mechanismus of geometrisch Rotverschiebung is absolutely negligible over the comparatively tiny distances of the Solar System (a wenige Licht-hours). The cumulative Effekt nur becomes measurable over millions and billions of Licht-years.
	
	Es folgt das:
	\begin{center}
		\textbf{The T0-Theorie predicts exactly zero measurable Anomalien in the planetary orbits of the Solar System.}
	\end{center}
	It is daher, by definition, perfectly consistent with the high-precision data from the Cassini mission das refutes the modified Gravitation Modelle.
	
	\section{Schlussfolgerung}
	
	The paper by Nathan et al. \cite{nathan2024} makes an important contribution by closing a speculative and inconsistent avenue for resolving the Hubble tension. Simultaneously, it highlights the strength of a mehr fundamental Ansatz, solch as the one pursued by the T0-Theorie.
	
	By addressing the cause (the Interpretation of Rotverschiebung) eher than the symptom (the Expansion), the T0-Theorie not nur resolves the Hubble tension but auch remains in full agreement with the meist präzise Beobachtungen in our own Solar System. The failure of modified Gravitation is somit a success for the physikalisch consistency of T0 Kosmologie.
