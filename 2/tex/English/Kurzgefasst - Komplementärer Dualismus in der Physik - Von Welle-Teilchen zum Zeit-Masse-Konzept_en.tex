	\begin{abstract}
		This document provides a brief introduction to time-mass duality, a new concept proposed as an extension of the established wave-particle duality in physics. It demonstrates how quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) can be enhanced by introducing an intrinsic time \( T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2} \) and a model with absolute time (T0 model). This dual perspective could help bridge gaps between QM and QFT, offering new approaches to gravitation, nonlocality, and cosmological phenomena.

	\section{Introduction: Duality in Modern Physics}
	
	Modern physics is characterized by dualistic concepts. Wave-particle duality describes how quantum objects, such as electrons or photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. These seemingly contradictory descriptions are complementary, together providing a more complete picture of reality.
	
	The two main pillars of modern physics—quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT)—also represent a form of duality:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Quantum Mechanics} emphasizes the discrete, particle-like nature of matter but integrates relativistic effects only incompletely.
		\item \textbf{Quantum Field Theory} combines quantum effects with special relativity but struggles to fully incorporate gravitation.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Building on this established duality, my work \cite{pascher_planck_2025} introduces a new, analogous duality: time-mass duality. This could close existing gaps between the theories and enable a more unified description of physical reality.
	
	\section{From Particles and Waves to Time and Mass}
	
	\subsection{The Classical Wave-Particle Duality}
	
	In quantum mechanics, there are two complementary descriptions of a phenomenon:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{Particle Description}: Localized objects with defined position and mass.
		\item The \textbf{Wave Description}: A spatially extended wavefunction.
	\end{itemize}
	
	These descriptions are mathematically linked via the Fourier transform:
	\begin{align}
		\Psi(\vecx) &= \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3/2}} \int \phi(\vec{p}) e^{i\vec{p}\cdot\vecx/\hbar} \, d^3p \\
		\phi(\vec{p}) &= \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3/2}} \int \Psi(\vecx) e^{-i\vec{p}\cdot\vecx/\hbar} \, d^3x
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{The New Time-Mass Duality}
	
	Similarly, the T0 model proposes a duality for relativistic phenomena:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{Time Dilation Description} (Standard Model): Time is variable (\( t' = \gammaf t \)), while rest mass remains constant (\( m_0 = \text{const.} \)).
		\item The \textbf{Mass Variation Description} (T0 Model): Time is absolute (\( \Tzero = \text{const.} \)), while mass is variable (\( m = \gammaf m_0 \)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	These two approaches are connected through a modified Lorentz transformation, as detailed in \cite{pascher_params_2025}.
	
	\section{The Concept of Intrinsic Time}
	
	A central element of the T0 model is intrinsic time, defined as:
	\begin{equation}
		\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{m c^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	This quantity is a fundamental property of every object and depends on its mass. It leads to a modified Schrödinger equation:
	\begin{equation}
		i\hbar \Tfield \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi + i\hbar \Psi \frac{\partial \Tfield}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
	\end{equation}
	
	Heavier objects experience faster internal time evolution than lighter ones, offering a new perspective on quantum mechanical dynamics, as elaborated in \cite{pascher_quantum_2025}.
	
	\section{Parallels Between the Dualities}
	
	The parallels between wave-particle and time-mass duality are striking:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Complementarity}: Position and momentum are as complementary as time and energy/mass.
		\item \textbf{Uncertainty Relations}: \(\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\) corresponds to \(\Delta t \Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}\) or \(\Delta \Tfield \Delta m \geq \frac{\hbar}{2c^2}\).
		\item \textbf{Transformations}: Both dualities are linked through mathematical transformations.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Necessary Extensions of QM and QFT}
	
	Time-mass duality requires adjustments to existing theories:
	
	\subsection{Extension of Quantum Mechanics}
	
	The classical Schrödinger equation is extended to account for intrinsic time:
	\begin{equation}
		i\hbar \Tfield \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi + i\hbar \Psi \frac{\partial \Tfield}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi
	\end{equation}
	
	This leads to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mass-dependent time evolution of quantum systems.
		\item A natural explanation for varying decay rates and coherence times.
		\item A new perspective on the measurement problem through the coupling of mass and time.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Extension of Quantum Field Theory}
	
	QFT is adapted to incorporate absolute or intrinsic time:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Field operators are reformulated in terms of \(\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{m c^2}\).
		\item Renormalization becomes reinterpretable through mass-dependent time scales.
		\item Virtual particles could be understood as manifestations of different intrinsic times.
	\end{itemize}
	
	These extensions could facilitate the integration of gravitation, the resolution of infinities, and a better understanding of vacuum energy.
	
	\section{The Reality of Time Dilation versus Mass Variation}
	
	Time dilation is often considered directly measurable (e.g., GPS, muon decay). However, these measurements rely on frequencies:
	\begin{equation}
		f = \frac{E}{h} = \frac{m c^2}{h}
	\end{equation}
	
	They can equally be interpreted as mass variation, as shown in \cite{pascher_planck_2025}. The experimental data remain the same—only the interpretation changes.
	
	\section{Effects on Instantaneity and Nonlocality}
	
	Nonlocality in quantum physics is reinterpreted in the T0 model:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In the absolute time model, correlations arise from mass variation (\( m = \gammaf m_0 \)), not instantaneously.
		\item In the intrinsic time model, entangled particles have different time evolutions based on \(\Tfield\).
		\item For photons, \(\Tfield = \frac{1}{E}\), yielding energy-dependent dynamics, as described in \cite{pascher_photons_2025}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This replaces instantaneous action with mass- or energy-dependent dynamics, testable through Bell experiments with variable masses or frequencies.
	
	\section{Consequences and Outlook}
	
	Time-mass duality offers new perspectives:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A framework for quantum gravity.
		\item An alternative to nonlocality through mass-dependent time evolution.
		\item A connection between QM and QFT via intrinsic time.
		\item Experimental verifiability through specific predictions.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Just as wave-particle duality revolutionized physics, time-mass duality could provide new insights and lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive theory.
