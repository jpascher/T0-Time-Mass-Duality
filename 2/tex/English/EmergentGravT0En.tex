		This work presents a comprehensive mathematical derivation of gravitation within the framework of the T0 model of time-mass duality. Starting from the fundamental assumption of an intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\), linked to mass via the relation \(m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}\) in a unified unit system, it demonstrates how gradients of this time field give rise to an emergent force exhibiting all characteristic properties of gravitation. The derivation proceeds through five complementary approaches: (1) via the Lagrangian density of the time field and its coupling to matter, (2) through comparison with Einstein's field equations in the post-Newtonian approximation, (3) via the connection to the Higgs mechanism, (4) through a thermodynamic perspective akin to Verlinde's entropic gravity theory, and (5) through an analysis of the link between time field fluctuations and cosmic expansion. It is shown that all approaches yield consistent predictions aligning with known gravitational effects, yet they predict novel deviations under extreme conditions or large scales, which are experimentally testable.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	The nature of gravitation remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern physics. While General Relativity (GR) provides an elegant geometric description, portraying gravitation as spacetime curvature, numerous unresolved questions persist, particularly regarding the quantization of gravity and its unification with other fundamental interactions. Moreover, cosmological observations have led to the introduction of dark matter and dark energy to explain observed galaxy dynamics and cosmic acceleration.
	
	The T0 model of time-mass duality \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025} offers an alternative approach to describing gravitation. It is based on the fundamental assumption of an intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\), which, in a unified unit system, is related to mass through the relation \(m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}\) (see also \cite{pascher_zeit_2025} and \cite{pascher_higgs_2025}). In this model, gravitation is not a fundamental force but an emergent phenomenon arising from the interaction of matter with the time field.
	
	This work presents a comprehensive mathematical derivation of gravitation in the T0 model through various mutually complementary approaches. The goal is to demonstrate that the styling model not only provides a consistent description of known gravitational phenomena but also makes novel, testable predictions that distinguish it from other gravitation theories.
	
	In the following, we first summarize the foundations of the T0 model in the unified unit system and then present five distinct derivation paths for emergent gravitation: via the Lagrangian density of the time field, through equivalence to GR in the post-Newtonian approximation, via the connection to the Higgs mechanism, through a thermodynamic perspective, and finally through the link to cosmic expansion. We conclude by discussing the experimental implications and testable predictions.
	
	\section{Foundations of the T0 Model}
	\label{sec:foundations}
	
	\subsection{The Intrinsic Time Field and Time-Mass Duality}
	\label{subsec:intrinsic_time}
	In the unified unit system of the T0 model, where all fundamental constants are set to 1 (\(\hbar = c = G = \alphaEM = \betaT = \alphaW = 1\)), as described in \cite{pascher_alpha_2025,pascher_alphabeta_2025}, the central relationship between the intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\) and mass takes a particularly elegant form:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:mass_time_relation}
		m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}
	\end{equation}
	
	This simple inverse relation highlights the fundamental duality between time and mass that forms the core of the T0 model, as elaborated in \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025}. The presence of mass leads to a local reduction of the time field, resulting in gradients perceived as gravitational force (see \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian}).
	
	\subsection{Dimensions in the Unified Unit System}
	\label{subsec:dimensions}
	In the unified unit system, all physical quantities are reduced to the dimension of energy, as detailed in \cite{pascher_alphabeta_2025}:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Length: $[L] = [E^{-1}]$
		\item Time: $[T] = [E^{-1}]$
		\item Mass: $[M] = [E]$
		\item Temperature: $[T_{\text{emp}}] = [E]$ (see \cite{pascher_temp_2025})
		\item Electric Charge: $[Q] = [1]$ (dimensionless when $\alphaEM = 1$)
		\item Intrinsic Time: $[\Tfield] = [E^{-1}]$
	\end{itemize}
	
	This dimensional structure underscores the fundamental role of energy as the basic physical quantity, a principle that will be crucial for our derivation of gravitational effects in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian,sec:gr_equivalence,sec:higgs_connection}.
	
	\subsection{Fundamental Equations of the T0 Model}
	\label{subsec:fundamental_equations}
	The dynamics of the time field \(\Tfield\) are described by a simplified field equation (see \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025,pascher_higgs_2025}):
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:time_field_dynamic}
		\grad^2 \Tfield - \frac{\partial^2 \Tfield}{\partial t^2} = -\rho(\vecx) \Tfield^2
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\rho(\vecx)\) is the mass density with dimension \([E^2]\) in natural units. For static mass distributions, this equation simplifies to:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:time_field_static}
		\grad^2 \Tfield = -\rho(\vecx) \Tfield^2
	\end{equation}
	
	This elegant form of the field equation, which will be derived from the Lagrangian density in \cref{subsec:field_equation}, reveals the direct relationship between mass distribution and time field geometry, from which gravitation emerges as an emergent phenomenon (see \cref{subsec:emergent_force}).
	
	\section{Derivation of Gravitation via the Lagrangian Density}
	\label{sec:derivation_lagrangian}
	
	\subsection{Lagrangian Density of the Time Field}
	\label{subsec:lagrangian_density}
	The first approach to deriving emergent gravitation in the T0 model proceeds through the Lagrangian density of the time field. In the unified unit system with \(\hbar = c = G = \alphaEM = \betaT = \alphaW = 1\) (see \cref{subsec:dimensions}), the Lagrangian density takes a particularly elegant form.
	
	As outlined in \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025,pascher_messdifferenzen_2025}, the total Lagrangian density can be written as the sum of various contributions:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:total_lagrangian}
		\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{Boson}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Fermion}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs-T}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}}
	\end{equation}
	
	The intrinsic Lagrangian density of the time field in its complete form combines both the free field dynamics and matter interactions:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:intrinsic_lagrangian_complete}
		\mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}}^{\text{complete}} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \Tfield \partial^\mu \Tfield - \frac{1}{2}\Tfield^2}_{\text{Free field dynamics}} + \underbrace{\bar{\psi} \left( i\hbar \gamma^0 \frac{\partial}{\partial (t/\Tfield)} - i\hbar \gamma^0 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \right) \psi}_{\text{Interaction with matter}}
	\end{equation}
	
	In applications focusing on field interactions with matter distributions, this can be reformulated as:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:intrinsic_lagrangian_matter}
		\mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}}^{\text{matter}} = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu \Tfield \partial^\mu \Tfield - \frac{1}{2}\Tfield^2 - \frac{\rho}{\Tfield}
	\end{equation}
	
	where the last term represents the coupling to matter with density $\rho$ having dimension $[E^2]$ in natural units.
	
	This concise form directly incorporates both the self-interaction and matter coupling, reflecting the fundamental time-mass relation \(m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}\) from \cref{eq:mass_time_relation}. This formulation will be important for our derivation of the field equation in \cref{subsec:field_equation}.
	
	\subsection{Derivation of the Field Equation}
	\label{subsec:field_equation}
	The Euler-Lagrange equations for the time field can be derived from the Lagrangian density in \cref{eq:intrinsic_lagrangian_matter}:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:euler_lagrange}
		\partial_\mu \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial(\partial_\mu \Tfield)} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \Tfield} = 0
	\end{equation}
	
	Substituting the Lagrangian density yields:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:substituted_euler_lagrange}
		\partial_\mu \partial^\mu \Tfield + \Tfield + \frac{\rho}{\Tfield^2} = 0
	\end{equation}
	
	For static situations, this simplifies to:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:field_equation_static}
		\grad^2 \Tfield + \Tfield + \frac{\rho}{\Tfield^2} = 0
	\end{equation}
	
	In regions with high mass density, the term \(\frac{\rho}{\Tfield^2}\) dominates, further simplifying the equation to:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:field_equation_high_density}
		\grad^2 \Tfield \approx -\frac{\rho}{\Tfield^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	This equation, which is identical to \cref{eq:time_field_static}, describes how the time field is modified by the presence of mass, forming the basis for emergent gravitation as we will see in \cref{subsec:emergent_force}. The consistency of this derivation with the approach in \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025} and \cite{pascher_higgs_2025} demonstrates the mathematical coherence of the T0 model.
	
	\subsection{Calculation of the Emergent Force}
	\label{subsec:emergent_force}
	The motion of a test particle in the time field can be described by the Lagrangian:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:particle_lagrangian}
		L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{\vecx}^2 - m\Phi(\vecx)
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\Phi(\vecx)\) is the effective potential. According to the time-mass relation \(m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}\) from \cref{eq:mass_time_relation}, the effective mass of the particle depends on the local value of the time field.
	
	The corresponding potential takes the form (see \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025}):
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:effective_potential}
		\Phi(\vecx) = -\ln\left(\frac{\Tfield(\vecx)}{\Tzero}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\Tzero\) is the asymptotic value of the time field at infinity. This leads to the force:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:force_general}
		\vec{F} = -\grad \Phi = -\frac{\grad \Tfield}{\Tfield}
	\end{equation}
	
	For a point mass \(M\) at distance \(r\), the field equation \cref{eq:field_equation_high_density} yields the time field distribution:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:time_field_point_mass}
		\Tfield(r) = \Tzero\left(1 - \frac{M}{r}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	Substituting this into \cref{eq:force_general} directly results in Newton's law of gravitation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:newton_law}
		\vec{F} = -\frac{M}{r^2} \hat{r}
	\end{equation}
	
	In the unified unit system, the elegance of this derivation becomes particularly evident: gravitation emerges naturally from the geometry of the time field without requiring additional coupling constants. We will see in \cref{sec:gr_equivalence} how this emergent force relates to General Relativity, and in \cref{sec:higgs_connection} how it connects to the Higgs mechanism.
	
	\section{Equivalence to General Relativity in the Post-Newtonian Approximation}
	\label{sec:gr_equivalence}
	
	\subsection{Post-Newtonian Parameterization in the Unified Unit System}
	\label{subsec:post_newtonian}
	The second approach to deriving gravitation in the T0 model examines its equivalence to General Relativity (GR) in the post-Newtonian approximation. This approach complements the Lagrangian derivation in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian} by showing how the T0 model aligns with established gravitational theories. In the unified unit system with all fundamental constants set to 1 (see \cref{subsec:dimensions}), this equivalence can be presented with particular elegance.
	
	In the post-Newtonian parameterization, the spacetime metric is expressed as:
	
	\begin{align}
		g_{00} &= -1 + 2\Phi - 2\beta\Phi^2 + \dots \\
		g_{0i} &= -\frac{7}{2}\zeta \Phi_i + \dots \\
		g_{ij} &= (1 + 2\gamma\Phi)\delta_{ij} + \dots
	\end{align}
	
	where \(\Phi\) is the Newtonian gravitational potential, \(\Phi_i\) is a vector potential, and \(\beta\), \(\gamma\), \(\zeta\) are the post-Newtonian parameters. In GR, these parameters have the values \(\beta = \gamma = \zeta = 1\).
	
	\subsection{Time Field and Post-Newtonian Parameters}
	In the T0 model, the time field \(\Tfield\) can be directly related to the metric. For weak fields:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Tfield(\vecx) = \Tzero(1 - \Phi(\vecx) + \dots)
	\end{equation}
	
	By substituting into the time field's field equation and comparing with the post-Newtonian equations, the parameters in the unified unit system are:
	
	\begin{align}
		\beta &= 1 \\
		\gamma &= 1 \\
		\zeta &= 1
	\end{align}
	
	These values match those of GR exactly, demonstrating complete equivalence between the two theories in this approximation.
	
	\subsection{Light Deflection and Perihelion Precession}
	With the post-Newtonian parameters \(\beta = \gamma = \zeta = 1\), the T0 model makes identical predictions to GR for classical tests such as light deflection and perihelion precession.
	
	The deflection of light by a mass \(M\) is given by:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\delta\phi = \frac{4M}{b}(1 + \gamma) = \frac{8M}{b}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(b\) is the impact parameter.
	
	The perihelion precession per orbit for an elliptical path is:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\delta\omega = \frac{6\pi M}{a(1-e^2)}(2 + 2\gamma - \beta) = \frac{24\pi M}{a(1-e^2)}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(a\) is the semi-major axis and \(e\) is the eccentricity of the orbit.
	
	These predictions align precisely with the experimentally confirmed values of GR, underscoring the equivalence of both theories in the post-Newtonian approximation.
	
	\section{Connection to the Higgs Mechanism}
	\label{sec:higgs_connection}
	
	\subsection{Parallels Between Time Field and Higgs Field}
	\label{subsec:higgs_parallels}
	The time field \(\Tfield\) and the Higgs field \(H\) exhibit fundamental conceptual parallels, as discussed in previous works \cite{pascher_higgs_2025,pascher_alpha_2025,pascher_alphabeta_2025}. This connection provides our third approach to understanding emergent gravitation in the T0 model, complementing the Lagrangian approach in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian} and the GR equivalence in \cref{sec:gr_equivalence}:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Both are scalar fields permeating all of space.
		\item Both are responsible for the emergence of mass—the Higgs field through direct coupling, the time field through inverse proportionality.
		\item Both have a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value that determines the universe's fundamental properties.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	In the unified unit system with \(\hbar = c = G = \alphaEM = \betaT = \alphaW = 1\), these parallels become particularly evident.
	
	\subsection{Time Field as a Dynamic Component of the Higgs Field}
	A natural mathematical connection between the time field \(\Tfield\) and the Higgs field \(H\) takes the form:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Tfield(\vecx) = \frac{|H(\vecx)|^2}{v^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(v\) is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. This relation is dimensionally consistent in the unified unit system, where energy is the fundamental unit.
	
	The fundamental time-mass relation \(m = \frac{1}{\Tfield}\) can now be written as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		m = \frac{v^2}{|H|^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	This reveals a deeper interpretation: a particle's effective mass arises from the ratio of the square of the vacuum expectation value to the local square of the Higgs field amplitude.
	
	\subsection{Consistency with Mass Relations}
	As shown in \cite{pascher_params_2025}, the parameter \(\betaT\) in the T0 model is derived from the relation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\betaT^{\text{nat}} = \frac{\lambda_h^2 v^2}{16\pi^3 m_h^2 \xi}{16\pi^3 m_h^2 \xi} \cdot \frac{1}{m_h^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\xi}
	\end{equation}
	
	With \(\betaT = 1\) in the unified unit system, we obtain:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\xi = \frac{\lambda_h^2 v^2}{16\pi^3 m_h^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	This links the characteristic length scale \(r_0 = \xi \cdot l_P\) directly to the Higgs parameters, demonstrating the deep connection between T0 dynamics and the Higgs mechanism.
	
	\subsection{Emergent Gravitation from Higgs Field Gradients}
	With the established connection between the time field and the Higgs field, we can now derive the gravitational force as a consequence of Higgs field gradients.
	
	From \(\Tfield = \frac{|H|^2}{v^2}\), it follows:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\grad \Tfield = \frac{2|H|\grad|H|}{v^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	The gravitational force on a mass object is given by:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = -\frac{\grad \Tfield}{\Tfield} = -\frac{2\grad|H|}{|H|}
	\end{equation}
	
	For a point mass \(M\) at the origin, in the weak-field approximation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		|H(r)| \approx v\left(1 - \frac{M}{2r}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	Substituting into the force equation yields Newton's law of gravitation exactly:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = -\frac{M}{r^2} \hat{r}
	\end{equation}
	
	This demonstrates how, in the unified unit system of the T0 model, gravitation emerges as an emergent phenomenon from the Higgs field geometry without requiring additional parameters.
	
	\section{Thermodynamic Approach to Gravitation}
	\label{sec:thermodynamic}
	
	\subsection{Verlinde's Entropic Gravitation in the T0 Context}
	\label{subsec:verlinde}
	The thermodynamic approach to deriving gravitation in the T0 model is based on a concept akin to Erik Verlinde's theory of entropic gravitation. This fourth approach offers yet another perspective on the emergence of gravitational forces, complementing the three approaches in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian,sec:gr_equivalence,sec:higgs_connection}. In the unified unit system with \(\hbar = c = G = k_B = \alphaEM = \betaT = \alphaW = 1\) (see \cref{subsec:dimensions}), this approach can be formulated with particular elegance.
	
	The core idea is that gravitation is not a fundamental force but an emergent effect resulting from a system's tendency to maximize entropy. The intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\) plays the role of the fundamental field whose configuration determines entropy.
	
	\subsection{Entropy of the Time Field}
	In the unified unit system, the entropy density of the time field can be expressed in a particularly simple form:
	
	\begin{equation}
		s(\vecx) = -\Tfield(\vecx) \ln\left(\frac{\Tfield(\vecx)}{\Tzero}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	The total entropy is obtained by integrating over the entire spatial volume:
	
	\begin{equation}
		S = \int s(\vecx) d^3x
	\end{equation}
	
	This formulation aligns with the thermodynamic interpretation of temperature in the unified unit system, as outlined in \cite{pascher_temp_2025}.
	
	\subsection{Derivation of Gravitational Force from Entropy Change}
	The force on a particle due to entropy change can be expressed as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = T \grad S
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(T\) is the temperature. Using the entropy density defined above and considering \(\alphaW = 1\), this becomes:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = -T \grad\left[\Tfield \ln\left(\frac{\Tfield}{\Tzero}\right)\right]
	\end{equation}
	
	For small deviations of the time field from the reference value, \(\Tfield = \Tzero(1 - \Phi)\) with \(\Phi \ll 1\), this force can be approximated as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} \approx -T \Tzero \grad \Phi
	\end{equation}
	
	In the unified unit system with \(T = 1\) (due to \(\alphaW = 1\)), this simplifies to:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = -\Tzero \grad \Phi
	\end{equation}
	
	With \(\Phi = \frac{M}{r}\) for a point mass, we immediately obtain Newton's law of gravitation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F} = -\frac{M}{r^2} \hat{r}
	\end{equation}
	
	This derivation shows how, in the unified unit system, gravitation can emerge directly from thermodynamic principles without introducing additional parameters.
	
	\section{Time Field and Static Universe}
	\label{sec:static_universe}
	
	\subsection{Static Universe in the T0 Model}
	\label{subsec:static_universe_model}
	The fifth approach to deriving gravitation in the T0 model examines the connection between the time field and cosmic redshift. This approach provides a cosmological perspective that complements the previous four approaches in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian,sec:gr_equivalence,sec:higgs_connection,sec:thermodynamic}. Unlike the standard model, the T0 model implies a static universe where the observed redshift is explained not by spatial expansion but by an energy loss mechanism, as detailed in \cite{pascher_messdifferenzen_2025} and \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025}.
	
	In the unified unit system with \(\betaT = 1\), the relationship between the intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\) and the observed redshift \(z\) is expressed through a particularly elegant relation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\Tfield(r)}{\Tzero} = e^{-\alpha r} = \frac{1}{1+z}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\Tzero\) is the local value of the time field, \(r\) is the distance, and \(\alpha\) is a parameter that takes the value \(\alpha = 1\) in the unified unit system. This relation shows that the time field decreases exponentially with distance from the observer, leading to an exponential relationship between distance and redshift:
	
	\begin{equation}
		1 + z = e^{\alpha r}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection{Energy Loss and Redshift}
	In the T0 model, cosmic redshift arises from the interaction of photons with the intrinsic time field. Photons lose energy according to:
	
	\begin{equation}
		E(r) = E_0 e^{-\alpha r}
	\end{equation}
	
	This leads to a wavelength-dependent redshift that takes a particularly simple form in the unified unit system:
	
	\begin{equation}
		z(\lambda) = z_0 \left(1 + \ln \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(z_0\) is the redshift at the reference wavelength \(\lambda_0\). This wavelength dependence is a distinct signature of the T0 model, fundamentally distinguishing it from the standard cosmological model.
	
	\subsection{Temperature Scaling in a Static Universe}
	Another unique prediction of the T0 model is the modified temperature-redshift relation:
	
	\begin{equation}
		T(z) = T_0 (1+z)(1 + \ln(1+z))
	\end{equation}
	
	In contrast to the standard model, where \(T(z) = T_0 (1+z)\), the T0 model predicts systematically higher temperatures in cosmological objects. With \(\betaT = 1\), this effect becomes particularly pronounced, offering a clear experimental test of the model.
	
	\subsection{Comparison with the Standard Cosmological Model}
	To highlight the fundamental differences from the standard cosmological model, a direct comparison is useful. In the standard model, cosmic dynamics are described by the Friedmann equations:
	
	\begin{align}
		\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 &= \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3} \\
		\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} &= -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3p}{c^2}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}
	\end{align}
	
	where \(a(t)\) is the scale factor, \(\rho\) is the energy density, \(p\) is the pressure, \(k\) is the curvature parameter, and \(\Lambda\) is the cosmological constant. In the unified unit system, these simplify to:
	
	\begin{align}
		\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 &= \frac{8\pi}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3} \\
		\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} &= -\frac{4\pi}{3}(\rho + 3p) + \frac{\Lambda}{3}
	\end{align}
	
	These equations describe a dynamically expanding universe, in stark contrast to the static universe of the T0 model. While the standard model explains cosmic redshift through spacetime stretching (\(1+z = \frac{a_0}{a}\)), the T0 model attributes it to an energy loss mechanism (\(1+z = e^r\)).
	
	The blackbody temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales in the standard model as \(T(z) = T_0(1+z)\), whereas the T0 model predicts the modified relation \(T(z) = T_0(1+z)(1+\ln(1+z))\). These differing scaling laws provide a direct experimental test between the two models.
	
	Another fundamental difference concerns the need for dark matter and dark energy. The standard model requires approximately 25\% dark matter and 70\% dark energy to account for observed galaxy dynamics and accelerated expansion. In contrast, the T0 model naturally explains these phenomena through time field dynamics without introducing additional exotic components.
	
	\subsection{Modified Gravitational Potential}
	\label{subsec:modified_potential}
	In the static universe of the T0 model, the gravitational potential takes the form:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:modified_potential}
		\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\kappa\) has dimension \([E]\) in natural units and \(\kappa^{\text{SI}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m/s}^2\). This potential is derived from the time field equation \cref{eq:field_equation_high_density} and emerges naturally in the T0 framework as shown in \cite{pascher_params_2025} and \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025}. It is consistent with the potential form derived in all previous sections (\cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian,sec:gr_equivalence,sec:higgs_connection,sec:thermodynamic}).
	
	As detailed in \cite{pascher_params_2025}, the parameter \(\kappa\) can be expressed as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:kappa_betaT}
		\kappa^{\text{nat}} = \betaT^{\text{nat}} \cdot \frac{yv}{r_g^2}\betaT^{\text{nat}} \cdot \frac{yv}{r_g^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	With \(\betaT^{\text{nat}} = 1\) in natural units, \(y\) the Yukawa coupling, \(v\) the Higgs VEV, and \(r_g\) a characteristic length scale.
	
	On local scales (\(r \ll 1\) in natural units), the first term in \cref{eq:modified_potential} dominates, reproducing the Newtonian potential we derived in \cref{eq:newton_law}. On galactic scales, the linear term becomes significant, leading to a modified gravitational force:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:modified_force}
		\vec{F} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \hat{r} + \kappa\hat{r}
	\end{equation}
	
	This additional linear term produces an outward force that increases with distance, explaining the flat rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter, as analyzed in detail in \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025}. This modification is one of the central testable predictions of the T0 model discussed in \cref{sec:experiments}.
	
	\section{Experimental Tests and Predictions}
	\label{sec:experiments}
	In the unified unit system with \(\betaT = 1\), clear, experimentally testable predictions emerge that distinguish the T0 model from the standard cosmological model. These predictions arise from the consistent theoretical framework developed in \cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian,sec:gr_equivalence,sec:higgs_connection,sec:thermodynamic,sec:static_universe}:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Wavelength-Dependent Redshift:} With \(\betaT = 1\), the wavelength dependence becomes particularly pronounced:
		\begin{equation}
			z(\lambda) = z_0 \left(1 + \ln \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)
		\end{equation}
		This can be verified through precise spectroscopic measurements of the same object at different wavelengths.
		
		\item \textbf{Modified Gravitational Potential:} The gravitational potential 
		\begin{equation}
			\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r
		\end{equation}
		leads to a characteristic modification of galaxy dynamics without dark matter.
		
		\item \textbf{Hubble Relation in a Static Universe:} The relationship between redshift and distance
		\begin{equation}
			1 + z = e^{r}
		\end{equation}
		differs from the linear Hubble relation of the standard model and can be tested with precise distance measurements.
		
		\item \textbf{Modified Temperature Relation:} The temperature-redshift relation
		\begin{equation}
			T(z) = T_0 (1+z)(1 + \ln(1+z))
		\end{equation}
		results in systematically higher temperatures at high redshift compared to the standard model.
		
		\item \textbf{Absence of Primordial Gravitational Waves:} Since the T0 model does not require an inflationary scenario, it predicts no measurable primordial gravitational waves in the CMB polarization spectrum.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	A detailed discussion of these predictions and their experimental verification is provided in a separate document comparing the model's predictions with current observational data.
	
	\section{Summary and Outlook}
	\label{sec:summary}
	The T0 model of time-mass duality offers an elegant approach to describing gravitation as an emergent phenomenon. In the unified unit system, with all relevant constants set to 1 (see \cref{subsec:dimensions}), the mathematical formulations simplify significantly, revealing fundamental connections between seemingly disparate physical phenomena.
	
	The five presented derivation paths for emergent gravitation—via the Lagrangian density (\cref{sec:derivation_lagrangian}), the post-Newtonian approximation (\cref{sec:gr_equivalence}), the Higgs mechanism (\cref{sec:higgs_connection}), the thermodynamic approach (\cref{sec:thermodynamic}), and the static universe (\cref{sec:static_universe})—provide a consistent picture and yield specific, testable predictions outlined in \cref{sec:experiments}.
	
	These approaches, while distinct in their physical interpretations, all lead to the same modified gravitational potential form \(\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r\) as expressed in \cref{eq:modified_potential}. This remarkable consistency across different theoretical frameworks strengthens the mathematical foundation of the T0 model.
	
	Open questions, particularly regarding the quantization of the time field and its full integration into the Standard Model of particle physics, will be addressed in future work. The unified treatment of all natural forces within the T0 model framework remains a promising research goal, as detailed in \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025} and \cite{pascher_higgs_2025}.
