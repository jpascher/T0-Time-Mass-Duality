	\begin{abstract}
		This work examines the implications of assigning a dynamic, frequency-dependent effective mass to photons within the framework of the T0 model of time-mass duality, which postulates absolute time and variable mass. By assuming \(m_\gamma = \omega\) in natural units, an energy-dependent intrinsic time is introduced, influencing nonlocality and causality. The theory builds on the T0 model's fundamental relationship \(\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{\max(m c^2, \omega)}\) with dimension \([E^{-1}]\), and is supported by experimental predictions regarding wavelength-dependent redshift and energy-dependent quantum correlations.

	\section{Introduction}
	This work analyzes the implications of a dynamic, frequency-dependent effective mass for photons within the T0 model of quantum mechanics, which assumes absolute time and variable mass \cite{pascher_zeit_masse_2025, pascher_zeit_2025}. While photons are conventionally regarded as massless particles, the T0 model suggests assigning them an effective mass directly proportional to their frequency. This concept extends the model's intrinsic time framework to explore nonlocality and causality in quantum systems.
	
	The idea that photons might possess an effective mass is not entirely new—various theoretical frameworks have considered this possibility, particularly in the context of modified electrodynamics \cite{de_broglie1940, proca1936}. However, the T0 model approaches this from a unique perspective, viewing the photon's effective mass as a natural consequence of the fundamental time-mass duality principle.
	
	By considering how this effective photon mass interacts with the intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\), we uncover new insights into quantum entanglement and the apparent nonlocality of quantum measurements. This perspective offers a potential resolution to the tension between quantum mechanics and special relativity regarding instantaneous action at a distance, as explored in Bell's theorem \cite{bell}.
	
	\section{Natural Units as the Foundation}
	\subsection{Definition of Natural Units}
	\begin{theorem}[Natural Units]
		In a system with \(\hbar = c = G = 1\), physical quantities have the following dimensional relations:
		\begin{align}
			[L] &= [E^{-1}] \\
			[T] &= [E^{-1}] \\
			[M] &= [E]
		\end{align}
		where \([L]\) represents length, \([T]\) time, \([M]\) mass, and \([E]\) energy.
	\end{theorem}
	
	This dimensional analysis is crucial for maintaining consistency throughout the T0 model formulation. With energy as the fundamental dimension, all other physical quantities can be expressed in terms of energy, creating a unified dimensional framework \cite{pascher_alpha_2025}.
	
	\subsection{Significance for Mass-Energy Equivalence}
	In the T0 model, mass is not a static property but a dynamic quantity related to the intrinsic time field through \(\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{m c^2}\) \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025}. For photons, we propose an effective mass directly proportional to their energy:
	\begin{equation}
		m_\gamma = \omega
	\end{equation}
	where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the photon. This relationship is dimensionally consistent with \(E = \hbar \omega\) when using natural units (\(\hbar = 1\)), as energy and mass share the same dimension \([E]\).
	
	This effective mass concept allows us to treat photons and massive particles within a unified framework, where both follow the same fundamental relationship between mass and intrinsic time. The concept builds upon Einstein's mass-energy equivalence \cite{einstein} but extends it in a novel direction by associating an effective mass with photons that directly influences their intrinsic temporal properties.
	
	\section{Time Models in Quantum Mechanics}
	\subsection{Limitations of the Standard Model}
	The standard Schrödinger equation assumes a universal time parameter that applies equally to all quantum systems:
	\begin{equation}
		i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = H\psi
	\end{equation}
	
	This approach treats time as an external parameter rather than an operator, creating an asymmetry between space and time in quantum mechanics. This asymmetry has been noted as a conceptual limitation of standard quantum theory \cite{feynman}, and the T0 model addresses this by introducing the intrinsic time field \(\Tfield\) \cite{pascher_erweiterung_2025}.
	
	\subsection{The T0 Model with Absolute Time}
	In the T0 model, energy is fundamentally linked to a constant intrinsic time \(T_0\) through the relation:
	\begin{equation}
		E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
	\end{equation}
	
	For massive particles, the intrinsic time field is given by \(\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{m c^2}\), which varies inversely with mass. This relationship is central to the time-mass duality concept and leads to a modified Schrödinger equation as derived in \cite{pascher_lagrange_2025}:
	
	\begin{equation}
		i\hbar \Tfield \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} + i\hbar \psi \frac{\partial \Tfield}{\partial t} = H\psi
	\end{equation}
	
	This modified equation accounts for the particle-specific intrinsic timescale, allowing for a more nuanced treatment of quantum dynamics.
	
	\subsection{Extension for Photons}
	For photons, the intrinsic time concept extends naturally to an energy-dependent intrinsic time:
	\begin{equation}
		\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{m_\gamma c^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\omega c^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\omega} = \frac{1}{\omega}
	\end{equation}
	where the last equality applies in natural units with \(\hbar = c = 1\). This remains consistent with the proposed effective mass \(m_\gamma = \omega\) and aligns with the treatment of massive particles.
	
	This formulation implies that higher-energy photons have shorter intrinsic timescales, a prediction that could have observable consequences for high-energy astrophysical phenomena and quantum optics experiments \cite{pascher_emergente_gravitation_2025}.
	
	\section{Unification in the T0 Model}
	To unify the treatment of massive particles and photons within a single framework, we define the intrinsic time field as:
	\begin{equation}
		\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{\max(m c^2, \omega)}
	\end{equation}
	
	For massive particles at rest or low velocities, \(m c^2\) dominates and we recover the standard T0 model relation. For photons or ultra-relativistic particles, \(\omega\) becomes the determining factor. This unified expression maintains dimensional consistency with \(\Tfield\) having dimension \([E^{-1}]\) in natural units.
	
	This unification provides a seamless transition between the treatment of massive and massless particles, addressing a longstanding conceptual divide in quantum theory. It also offers new perspectives on quantum field theory, where particles can be viewed as excitations of fields with associated intrinsic timescales \cite{pascher_feldtheorie_2025}.
	
	\section{Implications for Nonlocality and Entanglement}
	\subsection{Energy-Dependent Correlations}
	The energy-dependent intrinsic time \(\Tfield\) for photons leads to interesting implications for quantum entanglement. In a system with entangled photons of different frequencies \(\omega_1\) and \(\omega_2\), the difference in their intrinsic times would be:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta \Tfield = \left|\frac{1}{\omega_1} - \frac{1}{\omega_2}\right|
	\end{equation}
	
	This time difference suggests that quantum correlations between entangled photons might not be truly instantaneous but could experience a slight delay related to their energy difference. While extremely small for typical laboratory energies, this effect could become significant for entangled systems involving high-energy photons or over cosmological distances.
	
	This perspective suggests that quantum nonlocality might emerge from intrinsic time differences rather than representing true action at a distance, potentially resolving the tension with special relativity. The mechanism bears conceptual similarity to the energy loss mechanism responsible for redshift in the T0 model \cite{pascher_messdifferenzen_2025}.
	
	\subsection{\(\betaT\) in the T0 Model}
	In the T0 model, the wavelength-dependent component of redshift is characterized by the parameter \(\betaT\), with \(\betaT^{\text{SI}} \approx 0.008\) in SI units and \(\betaT^{\text{nat}} = 1\) in natural units \cite{pascher_params_2025}. These values are mathematically equivalent, representing the same physical reality expressed in different unit systems.
	
	The conversion between these values is given by:
	\begin{equation}
		\betaT^{\text{SI}} = \betaT^{\text{nat}} \cdot \frac{\xi \cdot l_{P,\text{SI}}}{r_{0,\text{SI}}}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\xi \approx 1.33 \times 10^{-4}\) is a dimensionless parameter defining the characteristic length scale \(r_0 = \xi \cdot l_P\) \cite{pascher_temp_2025, pascher_alphabeta_2025}.
	
	The derivation of \(\betaT\) is well-established in the T0 model through the relation:
	\begin{equation}
		\betaT^{\text{nat}} = \frac{\lambda_h^2 v^2}{16\pi^3 m_h^2 \xi}{16\pi^3 m_h^2 \xi}
	\end{equation}
	
	With \(\xi = \frac{\lambda_h^2 v^2}{16\pi^3 m_h^2}\), we obtain \(\betaT^{\text{nat}} = 1\) naturally. The choice between using \(\betaT^{\text{SI}}\) and \(\betaT^{\text{nat}}\) depends solely on the unit system being employed and does not reflect any uncertainty in the theoretical foundation.
	
	This parameter appears in the wavelength-dependent redshift formula:
	\begin{equation}
		z(\lambda) = z_0 \left(1 + \betaT \ln\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	which represents a distinctive prediction of the T0 model that could be tested through high-precision spectroscopic observations \cite{pascher_messdifferenzen_2025}.

	\section{Experimental Verification}
	The dynamic mass concept for photons in the T0 model leads to several experimentally testable predictions:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Frequency-dependent Bell Tests:} Experiments could be designed to measure potential time delays in quantum correlations between entangled photons of different frequencies. The predicted delay \(\Delta \Tfield = \left|\frac{1}{\omega_1} - \frac{1}{\omega_2}\right|\) would be extremely small but might be detectable with ultra-precise timing measurements in quantum optics.
		
		\item \textbf{Wavelength-dependent Redshift:} The formula \(z(\lambda) = z_0 \left(1 + \betaT \ln\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\) predicts a distinctive wavelength dependence of cosmological redshift that could be tested through high-precision spectroscopic observations of distant sources across multiple wavelength bands, as discussed in \cite{pascher_messdifferenzen_2025}.
		
		\item \textbf{High-energy Photon Propagation:} The energy-dependent intrinsic time could lead to subtle energy-dependent propagation effects for high-energy gamma rays traveling over cosmological distances, potentially detectable with gamma-ray telescopes observing distant energetic events like gamma-ray bursts \cite{pascher_galaxies_2025}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	These experimental tests would provide crucial validation for the T0 model's treatment of photons and its implications for quantum nonlocality. The specific predictions differ quantitatively from both standard quantum mechanics and conventional quantum gravity approaches, offering clear distinguishing criteria.
	
	\section{Physics Beyond the Speed of Light}
	The T0 model with dynamic photon mass suggests the possibility of a modified dispersion relation for photons:
	\begin{equation}
		E^2 = (m_\gamma c^2)^2 + (p c)^2 + \alpha_c \frac{p^4 c^2}{E_P^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \(\alpha_c\) is a dimensionless coupling constant and \(E_P\) is the Planck energy. The additional term represents a quantum gravity correction that becomes significant only at very high energies.
	
	This modified relation could explain potential anomalies in the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and gamma rays. It could be tested through precise timing observations of photons from distant gamma-ray bursts across different energy bands, as higher-energy photons would experience slightly different propagation times due to the energy-dependent term.
	
	Such modifications to dispersion relations have been considered in various quantum gravity approaches, but the T0 model provides a unique perspective by relating them directly to the intrinsic time field concept. Further theoretical development of these ideas is presented in \cite{pascher_planck_2025}, which examines physics beyond the Planck scale.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	The dynamic effective mass of photons in the T0 model offers a novel perspective on quantum nonlocality as an emergent phenomenon driven by energy-dependent intrinsic time. By assigning photons a frequency-dependent effective mass \(m_\gamma = \omega\), we establish a unified framework for treating both massive and massless particles through the intrinsic time field \(\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{\max(m c^2, \omega)}\).
	
	This approach suggests that quantum correlations in entangled systems might not be truly instantaneous but could exhibit subtle energy-dependent delays, potentially resolving the tension between quantum nonlocality and relativistic causality. The wavelength-dependent redshift formula \(z(\lambda) = z_0 \left(1 + \betaT \ln\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\) provides a distinctive experimental signature of this framework.
	
	The T0 model's treatment of photons enhances its explanatory power and creates a more unified theoretical framework connecting quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and gravitation. Future experimental tests, particularly high-precision measurements of wavelength-dependent redshift and energy-dependent quantum correlations, will be crucial for validating these theoretical insights.
