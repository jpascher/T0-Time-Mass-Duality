	\begin{abstract}
		This paper examines the relationship between the T0 model of time-mass duality and established calculation methods in physics, with particular focus on the Dirac equation and relativistic formalisms. A central aspect is the analysis of which elements have already been successfully integrated into the T0 model and which still require formal extension. The paper emphasizes that our scientific thinking is historically shaped by the relativistic perspective, leading to interpretive biases—particularly in cosmology. It is argued that the experimental measurement data themselves are correct but must be reinterpreted within the T0 framework. While the T0 model, with its assumption of absolute time and variable mass, takes a fundamentally different ontological standpoint, it can fully reproduce the quantitative successes of established formalisms. The philosophical implications of these competing but mathematically equivalent descriptions are analyzed, as is the concrete development status of the T0 formalism in various physical subfields.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	
	The development of modern physics in the 20th century is characterized by two fundamental theories: relativity theory and quantum mechanics. While these theories have achieved extraordinary success in their respective domains, their unification remains one of the greatest challenges of theoretical physics. The T0 model of time-mass duality offers a novel approach to bridging this gap by questioning and reinterpreting the fundamental assumptions of both theories.
	
	In contrast to relativity theory, which postulates relative time and constant mass, the T0 model inverts these assumptions: it introduces absolute time and variable mass, mediated by the intrinsic time field $\Tfieldt = \frac{\hbar}{\max(m(\vecx,t)c^2, \omega(\vecx,t))}$. This conceptual inversion raises the question of how established calculation methods—particularly the Dirac equation and relativistic formalisms—can be understood and integrated into this alternative framework.
	
	In this paper, we examine the current state of development of the T0 model regarding its integration of established calculation methods. We analyze:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Which aspects of established formalisms have already been successfully integrated into the T0 model
		\item Which areas still require further formal development
		\item How experimental data traditionally interpreted in the relativistic framework can be reunderstood in the T0 model
		\item The philosophical implications of a parallel mathematical description of physical reality
	\end{enumerate}
	
	A special focus is on the Dirac equation, which elegantly captures spin and antimatter with its $4 \times 4$ matrix structure, as well as on the precise predictions of General Relativity for gravitation-based phenomena.
	
	The central thesis of this paper is that the T0 model does not stand in confrontation with established calculation methods but integrates them into a more comprehensive conceptual framework that leads to new insights, particularly in cosmological questions.
	
	\section{Historical Influence of the Relativistic Perspective}
	\label{sec:historical_bias}
	
	\subsection{The Einsteinian Paradigms and Their Anchoring in Scientific Thinking}
	\label{subsec:einstein_paradigms}
	
	Relativity theory has fundamentally shaped our understanding of space, time, and gravitation since its formulation by Einstein over a century ago. Its central concepts—the relativity of simultaneity, the equivalence of mass and energy, spacetime curvature as the cause of gravitation—have penetrated scientific thinking so deeply that they are often no longer viewed as theoretical constructs but as indisputable truths.
	
	This historical influence leads to a specific interpretive bias, where physical phenomena are automatically interpreted within the framework of relativistic paradigms. Thomas Kuhn described in his work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" \cite{kuhn1962} how dominant paradigms shape not only theoretical explanations but also the entire perception and interpretation of observations.
	
	The relativistic bias is particularly evident in three areas:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In the \textbf{language of physics}, where terms like "spacetime curvature," "time dilation," and "mass-energy equivalence" are used as self-evident descriptions of physical reality
		
		\item In the \textbf{interpretation of measurements}, where experimental data are routinely interpreted within the relativistic framework without considering alternative conceptual frameworks
		
		\item In \textbf{theoretical developments} that introduce new phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy to maintain relativistic basic assumptions rather than questioning these assumptions themselves
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This issue of historical influence is particularly discussed in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0-ModelAsCompleteTheory_En.pdf}{The T0 Model as a More Complete Theory} (in the chapter "Misinterpretations of Incomplete Theories"), where the dangers of misinterpreting incomplete theories as ontologically correct are addressed.
	
	\subsection{The Reinterpretation of Measurement Data: Facts vs. Interpretation}
	\label{subsec:data_reinterpretation}
	
	A fundamental aspect of the T0 model is the distinction between experimental measurement data and their interpretation. The measurement data themselves—be it the precession of Mercury, light deflection by the Sun, or cosmic redshift—are not disputed. What is newly evaluated is the conceptual framing of these measurements.
	
	The redshift of light from distant galaxies excellently illustrates this point:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Measurement datum:} The light of distant galaxies shows a systematic shift toward longer wavelengths.
		
		\item \textbf{Conventional interpretation:} This redshift is interpreted as a Doppler effect due to cosmic expansion, leading to the Big Bang theory.
		
		\item \textbf{T0 interpretation:} The same redshift is understood as energy loss of photons during their propagation through the intrinsic time field, without cosmic expansion.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Both interpretations can explain the measurement data with equal precision but with completely different conceptual and cosmological implications. This distinction between measurement data and interpretation is crucial for the scientific evaluation of the T0 model: it is not an alternative "set of facts" but an alternative conceptual framing of the same empirical data.
	
	The detailed reinterpretation of cosmological measurement data is extensively explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the chapters on "Wavelength-Dependent Redshift" and "Cosmological Interpretation").
	
	\section{The Dirac Equation in the T0 Model}
	\label{sec:dirac_equation}
	
	\subsection{Successes and Precision of the Dirac Equation}
	\label{subsec:dirac_success}
	
	The Dirac equation 
	\begin{equation}
		(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi = 0
	\end{equation}
	represents one of the most remarkable successes of theoretical physics. Its achievements include:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{unification of quantum mechanics and special relativity} for fermions in a coherent mathematical structure
		
		\item The \textbf{prediction of the existence of antimatter}, which was later experimentally confirmed by the discovery of the positron
		
		\item A natural explanation for the \textbf{intrinsic spin} of electrons and other fermions
		
		\item The basis for \textbf{quantum electrodynamics (QED)}, which enables physical predictions with a precision of up to 13 decimal places
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These impressive successes make the Dirac equation a benchmark for any alternative physical theory, including the T0 model.
	
	\subsection{Integration Already Achieved in the T0 Model}
	\label{subsec:dirac_integration}
	
	Analysis of the documents shows that the T0 model has already made substantial progress in integrating the Dirac equation:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{extension of the modified Schrödinger equation}:
		\begin{equation}
			i\hbar \Tfieldt \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} + i\hbar \Psi \left[\frac{\partial \Tfieldt}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla\Tfieldt\right] = \hat{H} \Psi
		\end{equation}
		forms the basis for relativistic quantum mechanics in the T0 framework. This equation is derived in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/DynamicTF-SchrodingerExtensions_En.pdf}{Dynamic Extension of the Intrinsic Time Field} (in the chapter on "Extended Schrödinger Equation").
		
		\item The \textbf{interpretation of spin} as an intrinsic property of the interplay between the time field and quantum systems is developed in detail in several documents.
		
		\item An approach to the \textbf{explanation of antimatter} as a specific configuration of the time field is present, with charge conjugation understood as a reversal of certain time field properties.
		
		\item The conceptual framework for an \textbf{extension of the time field to a tensor or complex field} that can naturally capture spin degrees of freedom is developed.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These advances show that the T0 model does not reject the central aspects of the Dirac equation but reinterprets them within an alternative conceptual framework.
	
	\subsection{Remaining Extension Needs}
	\label{subsec:dirac_extensions}
	
	Despite substantial progress, there are areas that require further formal development:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item An \textbf{explicit mathematical formulation} that shows how the $4 \times 4$ matrix structure of the Dirac equation can be directly derived from the T0 formalism
		
		\item The \textbf{formal derivation of the spin-statistics theorem} in the context of the T0 model to explain the connection between spin and Fermi-Dirac statistics
		
		\item \textbf{Precision calculations for QED phenomena} such as the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in the T0 formalism to enable direct comparisons with conventional results
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These remaining developments do not represent conceptual obstacles but rather the natural development path of a comprehensive physical theory, as discussed in the earlier sections of this document (see Section \ref{sec:introduction} on the development trajectory).
	
	\section{Relativistic Calculations in the T0 Model}
	\label{sec:relativistic_calculations}
	
	\subsection{Classical Tests of General Relativity}
	\label{subsec:gr_tests}
	
	General Relativity (GR) has made a series of precise predictions that have been confirmed by observations:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{perihelion precession of Mercury} (43 arc seconds per century)
		\item The \textbf{light deflection} by the Sun during solar eclipses
		\item The \textbf{gravitational redshift} of light in gravitational fields
		\item \textbf{Gravitational waves}, as detected by LIGO and Virgo
		\item The \textbf{structure of black holes}, confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope
	\end{itemize}
	
	These predictions represent another benchmark for the T0 model.
	
	\subsection{Successful Reproduction of Relativistic Effects}
	\label{subsec:gr_reproduction}
	
	The T0 model can successfully reproduce all these effects through its modified gravitational potential:
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r
	\end{equation}
	
	The documents show that:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Gravitational waves} in the T0 model are described as the propagation of disturbances in the time field, according to the dynamic field equation:
		\begin{equation}
			\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}\Tfieldt + \Tfieldt + \frac{\rho(\vecx,t)}{\Tfieldt^2} = 0
		\end{equation}
		This interpretation is developed in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/EmergentGravT0En.pdf}{Emergent Gravitation in the T0 Model}.
		
		\item \textbf{Black holes} are understood as extreme configurations of the time field that provide equivalent predictions to the relativistic Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions
		
		\item \textbf{Perihelion precession} and other classical tests are precisely described by the time field dynamics, as explained in Section \ref{subsec:classical_tests} of this document.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This successful reproduction of relativistic effects shows that the T0 model is not a rejection of established physical insights but a reinterpretation within a more comprehensive conceptual system.
	
	\subsection{Cosmological Reinterpretations}
	\label{subsec:cosmological_reinterpretation}
	
	The most significant difference between the T0 model and conventional relativistic interpretation is evident in cosmology:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Cosmic redshift:} Rather than as an expansion effect, this is interpreted as energy loss of photons during their propagation through the time field.
		
		\item \textbf{Wavelength-dependent redshift:} The T0 model predicts a characteristic dependence according to $z(\lambda) = z_0 (1 + \betaT \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0))$, which allows for a crucial experimental test, as explained in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the chapter on "Wavelength-Dependent Redshift Prediction").
		
		\item \textbf{Static vs. expanding universe:} The T0 model postulates a static, eternal universe without a Big Bang, in contrast to the expanding universe of the standard model.
		
		\item \textbf{Dark matter and dark energy:} These are not considered as separate entities but are explained as natural consequences of the modified gravitational potential, as detailed in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/MassVarGalaxienEn.pdf}{Mass Variation in Galaxies}.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These reinterpretations offer a conceptually simpler explanation of cosmological phenomena without additional ad hoc assumptions such as inflation, dark matter, or dark energy.
	
	\subsection{Curvature-Based Redshift in the Extended Standard Model}
	\label{subsec:esm_redshift}
	
	An important aspect of the Extended Standard Model (ESM) that deserves special attention is its mechanism of redshift. In contrast to the conventional standard model, which explains redshift as a Doppler effect through cosmic expansion, and also different from the T0 model with its energy loss mechanism, the ESM offers a curvature-based explanation:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Curvature-induced deflection:} Light is deflected by mass distributions and the modified curvature term $\kappa$ in the gravitational potential $\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r$.
		
		\item \textbf{Energy loss through deflection:} This deflection leads to a systematic energy loss of light during its propagation, which manifests as redshift.
		
		\item \textbf{No expanding universe:} Like the T0 model, the ESM also postulates a static universe, where redshift arises not through expansion but through this curvature-based mechanism.
		
		\item \textbf{Mathematical equivalence:} Despite the different conceptual mechanism, the mathematical formulation leads to identical observable predictions as the T0 model, including the wavelength-dependent redshift.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This curvature-based interpretation of the ESM represents an elegant bridge between the relativistic spacetime concept and the static universe model. It retains the concept of curved spacetime but fundamentally differently interprets its effects than the standard model. This creates a fascinating situation where three different conceptual frameworks—the conventional standard model with an expanding universe, the T0 model with time field-based energy loss, and the ESM with curvature-based deflection—exist, with the latter two leading to mathematically equivalent predictions.
	
	These conceptual differences are analyzed in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0vsESM_ConceptualAnalysisEn.pdf}{Conceptual Comparison of T0 Model and Extended Standard Model} (in the section on "Bridging Phenomena").
	
	\section{Conceptual Differences and Similarities Between T0 Model and ESM}
	\label{sec:conceptual_differences}
	
	\subsection{Fundamental Ontological Positions}
	\label{subsec:ontological_positions}
	
	The T0 model and the Extended Standard Model (ESM) offer two fundamentally different ontological frameworks that nevertheless lead to mathematically equivalent predictions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{T0 Model:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Postulates \textbf{absolute time} and \textbf{variable mass}
			\item Uses the \textbf{intrinsic time field} $\Tfieldt$ as a fundamental concept
			\item Explains gravitation as an \textbf{emergent effect} of the time field gradient
			\item Interprets redshift as \textbf{energy loss} through time field interaction
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Extended Standard Model (ESM):}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Maintains \textbf{relative time} and \textbf{constant mass}
			\item Introduces a \textbf{scalar field} $\Theta(\vecx,t)$ that modifies spacetime curvature
			\item Describes gravitation through \textbf{modified spacetime curvature}
			\item Explains redshift through \textbf{light deflection and energy loss} due to this curvature
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These fundamental differences in the ontological basis lead to completely different worldviews—despite identical empirical predictions. This illustrates how profound the interpretive freedom in physics can be, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0vsESM_ConceptualAnalysisEn.pdf}{Conceptual Comparison of T0 Model and Extended Standard Model} (in the chapter on "Ontological Status").
	
	\subsection{Mathematical Equivalence Despite Conceptual Differences}
	\label{subsec:mathematical_equivalence}
	
	The mathematical equivalence of both models is established through a transformation between their fundamental fields:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\Theta(\vecx,t) \propto \ln\left(\frac{\Tfieldt}{\Tzero}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	This logarithmic relationship makes it possible to translate any calculation in one formalism into the other. The most important equivalences include:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Gravitational potential:} In both models $\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r$, but with different conceptual justification
		
		\item \textbf{Wavelength-dependent redshift:} Both models predict $z(\lambda) = z_0 (1 + \betaT \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0))$
		
		\item \textbf{Gravitational waves:} Both models describe the same wave effects, but once as time field disturbances, once as curvature waves
		
		\item \textbf{Static universe:} Both reject cosmic expansion in favor of a static cosmology
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This mathematical equivalence makes the models empirically indistinguishable but reinforces the importance of conceptual and philosophical analysis as a decision criterion, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the chapter on "Mathematical Equivalence").
	
	\subsection{The Redshift Mechanism in Detail}
	\label{subsec:redshift_mechanism_detail}
	
	The redshift mechanism clearly shows the different conceptual approaches:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{T0 Model:} Redshift arises through direct energy loss of photons during their propagation through the time field, according to the differential equation:
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{dE}{dx} = -\alpha E \left(1 + \betaT \ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)
		\end{equation}
		The photons lose energy (and are redshifted) through direct interaction with the intrinsic time field, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the section on "Photon Energy Loss").
		
		\item \textbf{ESM:} Redshift arises through the deflection of light in the modified spacetime curvature. The deflection itself leads to an energy loss, which manifests as redshift:
		\begin{equation}
			\frac{dE}{dx} = -\frac{E}{c^2} \frac{d\Phi(x)}{dx} \left(1 + \betaT \ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)
		\end{equation}
		Here, the energy loss is coupled to the gradual deflection of light by the modified gravitational potential.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Both differential equations lead to the identical phenomenological relationship $1 + z = e^{\alpha d}$ for the redshift over distance $d$, but the underlying physical mechanism is understood fundamentally differently.
	
	\subsection{Philosophical Evaluation of the Equivalence}
	\label{subsec:philosophical_evaluation}
	
	The situation of the T0 model and the ESM is philosophically comparable to other cases of empirically equivalent theories:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Copernican vs. Ptolemaic system:} With sufficient epicycles, the geocentric worldview could provide the same predictions as the heliocentric one, but with a completely different conceptual framework.
		
		\item \textbf{Matrix mechanics vs. wave mechanics:} Heisenberg's and Schrödinger's different formulations of quantum mechanics were later recognized as mathematically equivalent.
		
		\item \textbf{Bohmian vs. Copenhagen interpretation:} Two fundamentally different interpretations of quantum mechanics that lead to the same empirical predictions.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	In such cases, criteria such as theoretical elegance, simplicity, or fruitfulness are often used. The T0 model and the ESM both offer elegance and simplicity, but in different ways: the T0 model through its ontological parsimony and natural choice of units, the ESM through its proximity to established relativistic concepts.
	
	This equivalence illustrates the fundamental insight that scientific theories do not depict reality "in itself" but represent models that are always shaped by conceptual framings. The decision between these models is ultimately a question of scientific and philosophical preference—with empirical adequacy being only one, albeit important, criterion.
	
	These philosophical aspects are discussed in depth in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0-ModelAsCompleteTheory_En.pdf}{The T0 Model as a More Complete Theory} (in the chapter on "Epistemological Humility Regarding the T0 Model"), where the importance of epistemological humility is also emphasized.
	
	\section{Further Established Formalisms in the T0 Context}
	\label{sec:other_formalisms}
	
	\subsection{Higgs Mechanism and Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}
	\label{subsec:higgs_mechanism}
	
	The documents show a substantial integration of the Higgs mechanism into the T0 model:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{modified covariant derivative}
		\begin{equation}
			\DhiggsTt = \Tfieldt (\partial_\mu + ig A_\mu) \Phi + \Phi \partial_\mu \Tfieldt
		\end{equation}
		establishes a direct coupling between the Higgs field and the intrinsic time field, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/ausblicke_En.pdf}{The Emerging Unified Framework} (in the section on "Coupled Lagrangian").
		
		\item The \textbf{quantitative relationship}
		\begin{equation}
			\xi = \frac{\lambda_h}{32\pi^3} \approx 1.33 \times 10^{-4}
		\end{equation}
		between the Higgs self-coupling parameter $\lambda_h$ and the fundamental T0 parameter $\xi$ shows a deep connection between the Standard Model and the T0 model, which is developed in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/NatEinheitenSystematikEn.pdf}{Hierarchical Compilation of Units in the T0 Model} (in the chapter on "Connection to Higgs Parameters").
		
		\item Electroweak symmetry breaking is understood in the T0 framework as a natural consequence of the interplay between the Higgs field and the time field.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This integration is particularly remarkable as it provides a natural explanation for the hierarchy problem without fine-tuning or supersymmetry.
	
	\subsection{Quantum Field Theory and Renormalization}
	\label{subsec:qft_renormalization}
	
	Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and renormalization theory are substantially addressed in the T0 model:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{Lagrangian density for the intrinsic time field}
		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}} = \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu}\Tfieldt\partial^{\mu}\Tfieldt - \frac{1}{2}\Tfieldt^2 - \frac{\rho(\vecx,t)}{\Tfieldt}
		\end{equation}
		forms the basis for a complete quantum field theory of the time field, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/DynamicTF-SchrodingerExtensions_En.pdf}{Dynamic Extension of the Intrinsic Time Field} (in the section on "Dynamic Field Lagrangian").
		
		\item The parameter $\betaT = 1$ is identified as a \textbf{renormalization group fixed point}:
		\begin{equation}
			\lim_{E \to 0} \betaT(E) = 1
		\end{equation}
		which points to a natural unification, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/Alpha1Beta1KonsistenzEn.pdf}{Unified Unit System in the T0 Model}.
		
		\item The \textbf{natural choice of units} of the T0 model with $\hbar = c = G = k_B = \alphaEM = \alphaW = \betaT = 1$ enables an elegant simplification of the field equations, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/NatEinheitenSystematikEn.pdf}{Hierarchical Compilation of Units in the T0 Model} (in the section on "Unification of Constants").
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These developments show that the T0 model is compatible with the established methods of quantum field theory not only conceptually but also technically.
	
	\subsection{Thermodynamics and Statistical Physics}
	\label{subsec:thermodynamics}
	
	The integration of thermodynamic concepts is evident in several aspects:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The \textbf{modified temperature-redshift relationship}
		\begin{equation}
			T(z) = T_0 (1+z)(1+\ln(1+z))
		\end{equation}
		offers an alternative explanation for the temperature evolution in the universe, as explained in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the section on "Cosmological Interpretation").
		
		\item The relationship between the \textbf{Planck spectrum and the intrinsic time field} enables a natural interpretation of the cosmic background radiation without a Big Bang scenario.
		
		\item The \textbf{statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics} is understood in the context of the T0 model as an expression of incomplete knowledge of the time field dynamics, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0-ModelAsCompleteTheory_En.pdf}{The T0 Model as a More Complete Theory} (in the chapter on "Statistical Methods as Approximations").
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These thermodynamic aspects complete the picture of a coherent physical framework that encompasses all essential areas of physics.
	
	\section{Quantitative Calculation of Classical Tests}
	\label{subsec:classical_tests}
	
	For a comprehensive practical application of the T0 model, precise equations for the classical tests are essential. The following formulas enable direct comparison with astronomical measurements:
	
	Perihelion precession per orbit:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta\phi = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2a(1-e^2)} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{\kappa a^2}{GM}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	Light deflection:
	\begin{equation}
		\Delta\theta = \frac{4GM}{c^2b} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{\kappa b^2}{2GM}\right)
	\end{equation}
	
	These formulas reproduce the classical tests of General Relativity while also including the additional term with the parameter $\kappa$, which becomes particularly relevant at larger scales.
	
	\section{Philosophical Implications}
	\label{sec:philosophical_implications}
	
	\subsection{Ontological Relativity and Theory Underdetermination}
	\label{subsec:ontological_relativity}
	
	The existence of two mathematically equivalent but conceptually different models—the T0 model with absolute time and variable mass and the extended standard model with relative time and constant mass—illustrates the philosophical principle of the underdetermination of scientific theories by empirical data.
	
	This situation is reminiscent of Quine's concept of ontological relativity: the question of which entities "really" exist—curved spacetime or variable mass with the intrinsic time field—cannot be decided by empirical data alone. This insight has profound implications for our understanding of scientific theories as models of reality, not as reality itself.
	
	These philosophical aspects are discussed in depth in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0vsESM_ConceptualAnalysisEn.pdf}{Conceptual Comparison of T0 Model and Extended Standard Model} (in the chapter on "Implications for Quantum Gravity and Cosmology").
	
	\subsection{Pragmatism and Theoretical Elegance}
	\label{subsec:pragmatism_elegance}
	
	The evaluation of competing theories must go beyond pure empirical adequacy and consider criteria such as theoretical elegance, simplicity, or fruitfulness.
	
	The T0 model distinguishes itself in this regard through several aspects:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Ontological parsimony:} It eliminates the need for dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the section on "Dark Matter and Dark Energy Reinterpretation").
		
		\item \textbf{Conceptual unity:} It provides a unified framework for quantum mechanics and gravitation, as developed in detail in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart1En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part I}.
		
		\item \textbf{Mathematical elegance:} Its natural choice of units simplifies the basic equations, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/NatEinheitenSystematikEn.pdf}{Hierarchical Compilation of Units in the T0 Model}.
		
		\item \textbf{Philosophical coherence:} It eliminates conceptual tensions such as Big Bang singularities and the information paradox of black holes.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	A pragmatic approach would consider both models as complementary perspectives, with the more useful description chosen in different contexts, as emphasized in the previous sections of this document.
	
	\subsection{Historical Parallels to Paradigm Shifts}
	\label{subsec:historical_parallels}
	
	The current situation is reminiscent of past paradigm shifts in the history of science:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The Copernican Revolution, which removed Earth from the center of the universe
		\item The transition from the phlogiston theory to the oxygen theory of combustion
		\item The replacement of Newtonian mechanics by relativity theory
	\end{itemize}
	
	In each of these cases, an established model of thinking was replaced by a conceptually different one that could explain the empirical data better or more elegantly. The possible replacement of the expansion paradigm by the static universe of the T0 model could represent a similar scientific revolution, as discussed in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0-ModelAsCompleteTheory_En.pdf}{The T0 Model as a More Complete Theory} (in the section on "Evolution Rather Than Completion").
	
	\section{Experimental Tests and Future Perspectives}
	\label{sec:experimental_tests}
	
	\subsection{Key Tests to Distinguish the Models}
	\label{subsec:key_tests}
	
	Despite the mathematical equivalence in many areas, there are experimental tests that could distinguish between the T0 model and the conventional relativistic approach:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Wavelength-dependent redshift:} The formula $z(\lambda) = z_0 (1 + \betaT \ln(\lambda/\lambda_0))$ with $\betaT^{\text{SI}} \approx 0.008$ implies a variation of about 2.3\% per wavelength decade, measurable with high-precision spectroscopy, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the section on "JWST Spectroscopy and Wavelength-Dependent Redshift").
		
		\item \textbf{CMB spectral distortions:} The modified temperature-redshift relationship predicts distinct $\mu$ and $y$ parameters that could be measurable with future CMB missions, as explained in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the section on "CMB Distortions").
		
		\item \textbf{Gravitational effects at the boundaries of conventional models:} The modified potential should show specific deviations from the GR predictions for very large scales.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These tests could provide decisive evidence for or against the T0 model.
	
	\subsection{Future Development Directions}
	\label{subsec:future_directions}
	
	The future development of the T0 model should focus on several areas:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Complete integration of the Dirac equation:} Development of an explicit formulation that shows how the Dirac structure emerges from the T0 formalism.
		
		\item \textbf{Detailed quantum field theory of the time field:} Elaboration of a complete perturbative treatment with renormalization, as proposed in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/DynamicTF-SchrodingerExtensions_En.pdf}{Dynamic Extension of the Intrinsic Time Field} (in the section on "Future Research Directions").
		
		\item \textbf{Numerical simulations of cosmic structures:} Development of detailed computer models to predict cosmic structure formation in the static universe.
		
		\item \textbf{Experimental validation campaigns:} Targeted observations to measure the wavelength-dependent redshift and other distinctive T0 predictions, as outlined in \href{https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf}{Bridging Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II} (in the "Conclusion" chapter).
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These developments could transform the T0 model from a promising alternative to an established physical theory.
	
	\section{Summary and Conclusions}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
	The analysis shows that the T0 model is not a rejection but a reinterpretation of established calculation methods and experimental data. Particularly noteworthy is:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{The successful integration} of the Dirac equation and relativistic effects into the T0 framework, albeit with conceptually different interpretation
		
		\item \textbf{The substantial treatment} of spin, antimatter, gravitational waves, and other established phenomena in the time field formalism
		
		\item \textbf{The identification of specific areas} that require further formal development, such as the explicit $4 \times 4$ matrix structure of the Dirac equation in the T0 context
		
		\item \textbf{The philosophical insight} that different conceptual frameworks can lead to mathematically equivalent but ontologically different descriptions of the same physical reality
	\end{enumerate}
	
	The historical influence of our scientific thinking by the relativistic perspective has possibly led to interpretive biases, particularly in cosmology. The T0 model offers an alternative interpretation that respects experimental measurement data but understands them in a conceptually different framework.
	
	The crucial question is not whether the measurement data are correct—they are—but which conceptual framework explains them most elegantly and comprehensively. The T0 model with its intrinsic time field offers a promising alternative in this regard that deserves further theoretical development and experimental testing.
