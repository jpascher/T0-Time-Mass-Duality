The Scientific Reports paper “A single-clock approach to fundamental metrology”
(Sci.\ Rep.\ 2024, DOI: 10.1038/s41598-024-71907-0) investigates to what extent
a single time standard is sufficient as a starting point to define and measure
all physical quantities (time intervals, lengths, masses). A central ingredient
is an explicit relativistic measurement protocol in which lengths are
determined solely from time differences. In addition, the authors argue,
using standard quantum relations (Compton wavelength) and modern metrological
techniques (Kibble balance), that masses can also be traced back to the time
standard.

This document gives a factual summary of the main technical elements
of the article and relates them to the T0 theory. In particular, it compares
the results to those of the existing T0 documents \texttt{T0\_SI\_En},
\texttt{T0\_xi\_origin\_En} and \texttt{T0\_xi-and-e\_En}, where the reduction
of all constants to the single parameter $\xi$ and the time–mass duality have
already been developed. A short remark on the popular-science video by
Hossenfelder places that video as a secondary summary, not as a primary
source.

\section{Introduction}

The article \emph{A single-clock approach to fundamental metrology}
\cite{terrell_single_clock_nature_2024} aims at reformulating the foundations
of metrology in such a way that a single time standard is sufficient to define
all other physical quantities. The authors in particular consider:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the definition and realization of time intervals by means of a single,
        highly stable time standard (a “clock”),
  \item the derivation of length measurements from purely temporal
        observational data in a relativistic setting,
  \item the reduction of masses to frequencies or time intervals using
        established quantum mechanical and metrological relations.
\end{itemize}

A popular-science presentation of this work appears in a video by
Hossenfelder \cite{hossenfelder_single_clock_video}. For the physical argument,
however, only the scientific article is decisive; the video is mentioned here
for orientation only.

In the T0 theory, \texttt{T0\_SI\_En} develops a comprehensive derivation
scheme in which all fundamental constants and units are obtained from a single
geometric parameter $\xi$. In \texttt{T0\_xi\_origin\_En} and
\texttt{T0\_xi-and-e\_En}, the time–mass duality is analyzed and the internal
structure of the mass hierarchy is derived from $\xi$. The purpose of the
present document is to systematically compare these T0 results with the
conclusions of the Scientific Reports article.

\section{Time standard and basic assumptions of the article}

\subsection{A single time standard}

In the Scientific Reports paper, the starting point is a single, high-precision
time standard. Operationally, this means that a reference frequency $\nu_0$ is
specified, whose period $T_0 = 1/\nu_0$ defines the elementary unit of time.
All other time intervals are given as multiples of $T_0$:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta t = n \, T_0 \, , \qquad n \in \mathbb{Z} \, .
\end{equation}
The concrete physical realization (e.g.\ caesium atomic clock, optical lattice
clock) is left open; what matters is the existence of a stable reference
process.

This basic assumption is directly analogous to the T0 theory, where the
Planck time $t_P$ and the sub-Planck scale $L_0 = \xi\,l_P$ are introduced as
characteristic scales determined by $\xi$ (\texttt{T0\_SI\_En}). T0 goes
further in that it derives the underlying time structure itself from $\xi$,
while the Scientific Reports article merely assumes the existence of a time
standard compatible with known physics.

\subsection{Relativistic framework}

The paper embeds the measurement procedures into special relativity. The key
roles are played by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item proper times of moving clocks along specified worldlines,
  \item relations between proper time, coordinate time and spatial distance
        according to the Minkowski metric,
  \item invariance of the light cone, which constrains the structure of
        space-time relations.
\end{itemize}

Formally, the proper time $d\tau$ of an idealized point particle with
four-velocity $u^\mu$ in flat space-time can be written as
\begin{equation}
  d\tau^2 = dt^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \, d\vec{x}^{\,2}
\end{equation}
(with a suitable choice of units). The concrete measurement protocols in the
article use this structure to infer spatial separations from measured proper
times.

\section{Length measurement from time: three-clock construction}

\subsection{Principle of the procedure}

The Nature article analyzes a type of experiment that is conceptually
equivalent to the three-clock set-up described by Hossenfelder. The central
idea is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two spatially separated events (the ends of a rigid rod) are separated
        by an unknown distance $L$.
  \item Clocks are transported along known worldlines between these points.
  \item The proper times accumulated by the transported clocks are finally
        compared at one location.
\end{itemize}

The authors show that from the proper times of the transported clocks and the
known kinematic conditions (e.g.\ constant speed) one can obtain an equation of
the form
\begin{equation}
  L = F\left(\{\Delta \tau_i\}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\{\Delta \tau_i\}$ denotes a finite set of measured proper time
differences and $F$ is a function determined by special relativity. The crucial
point is that $F$ does not require any independently measured length unit.

\subsection{Operational interpretation}

Operationally, this implies that a spatial distance $L$ can in principle be
fully determined from times:
\begin{equation}
  L = n_L \, T_0 \, c_{\text{eff}} \, .
\end{equation}
Here $T_0$ is the elementary time standard, $n_L$ is a dimensionless number
obtained from the proper-time measurements and knowledge of the dynamics, and
$c_{\text{eff}}$ is an effective velocity parameter which, while formally being
the speed of light, is not introduced as a separate base quantity. The article
emphasizes that no second, independent dimension (a separate meter standard) is
needed; the length scale follows from the time structure and the dynamics.

This is consistent with the derivation given in \texttt{T0\_SI\_En}, where the
meter in SI is defined via $c$ and the second, and where $c$ itself is derived
from $\xi$ and Planck scales. In T0, therefore, the length unit is already
reduced to the time structure before the metrological construction begins.

\section{Mass determination from frequencies and time}
\label{T0_threeclock:L-T0_threeclock-0547}

\subsection{Elementary particles: Compton relation}

For elementary particles, the article uses the well-known Compton relation
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{\mathrm{C}} = \frac{\hbar}{m c} \, ,
\end{equation}
and the corresponding Compton frequency
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{\mathrm{C}} = \frac{m c^2}{\hbar} \, .
\end{equation}
If lengths have already been defined by time measurements (as in the previous
section), it follows that the Compton wavelengths and the masses are also
fixed by the time standard. In natural units ($\hbar = c = 1$) this reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_{\mathrm{C}} = \frac{1}{m} \, , \qquad \omega_{\mathrm{C}} = m \, .
\end{equation}
Thus mass is a frequency quantity, i.e.\ an inverse time.

In the T0 theory, this observation appears explicitly in \texttt{T0\_xi-and-e\_En}
in the form
\begin{equation}
  T \cdot m = 1 \, .
\end{equation}
There it is shown that the characteristic time scales of unstable leptons are
consistent with their masses once $T$ is taken as a characteristic time and $m$
as mass in natural units. The argument of the Nature article regarding mass
determination via frequency measurements therefore finds, within T0, a
pre-existing formal elaboration.

\subsection{Macroscopic masses: Kibble balance}

For macroscopic masses, the Nature paper refers to the Kibble balance. This
device essentially operates in two modes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a static mode, in which the weight force $m g$ of a mass in the
        gravitational field is balanced by an electromagnetic force,
  \item a dynamic mode, in which induced voltages and currents are related to
        quantized electric effects and, finally, to frequencies.
\end{itemize}

By exploiting quantized electrical effects (Josephson voltage standards,
quantum Hall resistances), one obtains a chain
\begin{equation}
  m \longrightarrow F_{\text{weight}} \longrightarrow
  U, I \longrightarrow \text{frequencies, counting} \longrightarrow T_0 \, .
\end{equation}
Formally, the mass $m$ is thereby reduced to a function of frequencies (time
standards) and discrete charge counts. Again, no new continuous base quantities
appear; electrical and thermal constants are coupled to the time norm via
defining relations.

In T0, \texttt{T0\_SI\_En} derives the corresponding relations for $e$,
$\alpha$, $k_B$ and further constants from $\xi$, so that the Kibble balance
can be interpreted as an experimental realization of an already geometrically
fixed constants network.

\section{Relation to the T0 documents}
\label{T0_threeclock:L-T0_threeclock-0548}

\subsection{T0: From to SI constants}

\texttt{T0\_SI\_En} presents in detail how, starting from the single parameter
$\xi$, one can derive the gravitational constant $G$, Planck length $l_P$,
Planck time $t_P$ and finally the SI value of the speed of light $c$. The
central relation
\begin{equation}
  \xi = 2\sqrt{G \, m_{\text{char}}}
\end{equation}
and its variants ensure consistency with CODATA values and with the SI 2019
reform.

Against this background, the single-clock metrology of the Scientific Reports
paper can be interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The claim that a single time standard suffices is consistent with the
        T0 statement that $\xi$ as a single fundamental parameter suffices.
  \item The reduction of SI units to time and counting units mirrors the
        T0 description of reducing all constants to $\xi$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{T0: Mass scaling and}

\texttt{T0\_xi\_origin\_En} addresses how the concrete numerical value
$\xi = 4/30000$ emerges from the structure of the e–p–$\mu$ system, the
fractal space-time dimension and related considerations. This internal
justification level is absent from the Scientific Reports article: there, one
simply assumes that a time standard exists and can be reconciled with known
physics.

From the T0 perspective, the mass–frequency relation used in the article is
therefore not only accepted, but traced back to a deeper geometric level in
which mass ratios appear as consequences of $\xi$. The metrological statement
of the paper is thereby supported and at the same time embedded into a broader
theoretical framework.

\subsection{T0-and-e: Time–mass duality}

In \texttt{T0\_xi-and-e\_En}, the relation $T \cdot m = 1$ is highlighted as an
expression of a fundamental time–mass duality. The Scientific Reports article
uses this duality in the form of established relations (Compton wavelength,
mass–frequency relation) without explicitly formulating it as a duality.

The comparison shows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The article uses the duality operationally to argue that masses can be
        fixed by a time standard.
  \item The T0 theory formulates the duality explicitly and anchors it in the
        geometric structure (parameter $\xi$) and in the mass hierarchy of the
        particles.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quantum gravity and range of validity}
\label{T0_threeclock:L-T0_threeclock-0549}

The Nature article formulates its claims within the framework of established
physics, i.e.\ based on special relativity, quantum mechanics and the current
metrological standard model. Hossenfelder points out that the argument
implicitly assumes that clocks can, in principle, be used with arbitrarily high
precision. In the regime of Planck scales this expectation will likely fail,
since quantum-gravitational effects should lead to fundamental uncertainties.

The T0 theory addresses this issue by introducing Planck length, Planck time
and the sub-Planck scale as quantities determined by $\xi$. In
\texttt{T0\_SI\_En}, $L_0 = \xi\,l_P$ is discussed as an absolute lower bound of
space-time granulation. Planck scales thereby appear in T0 not as additional
parameters independent of $\xi$, but as derived quantities.

In this sense, the domain of validity of the single-clock metrology argument
can be characterized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Within the T0-described range (above $L_0$ and $t_P$), the reduction to
        a single time standard is consistent with the geometric structure.
  \item Below these scales, a modification of the measurement concept is to be
        expected; single-clock metrology does not provide a complete answer in
        this regime, and T0 proposes a concrete structure of these
        sub-Planck scales.
\end{itemize}

\section{Concluding remarks}

The Scientific Reports article on single-clock metrology shows that a
consistent use of special relativity, quantum mechanics and modern metrology
leads to the result that a single time standard is, in principle, sufficient to
define and measure all physical quantities. Length measurement from time
differences (three-clock construction) and mass determination via frequencies
and Kibble balances are the central technical building blocks.

The T0 theory, especially in \texttt{T0\_SI\_En}, \texttt{T0\_xi\_origin\_En}
and \texttt{T0\_xi-and-e\_En}, provides a complementary viewpoint in which
these operational facts are traced back to a single geometric parameter $\xi$.
Time is the primary quantity; mass appears as inverse time, and all SI
constants are derived from $\xi$ or interpreted as conventions. The
single-clock metrology of the article can thus be viewed as a metrological
confirmation of the time–mass duality and single-parameter structure postulated
in T0.
