		This paper introduces the foundational concepts of the Time-Mass Duality theory, a new approach to understanding fundamental physical phenomena. We present:
		
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item A complementary model to relativity featuring absolute time and variable mass

	\section{Introduction}
	
	The development of modern physics has been characterized by profound conceptual revolutions. From Bohr's complementarity principle \cite{Bohr1928} to Einstein's relativity \cite{Einstein1905}, fundamental physical theories have repeatedly challenged our intuitive understanding of reality. This paper continues in this tradition by introducing two novel and logically coherent approaches in theoretical physics: the complementary standard model of relativity theory with absolute time, and a modified Schrödinger equation with a mass-dependent intrinsic time.
	
	The concept of duality has proven extremely fruitful in physics. Wave-particle duality, formalized in de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis \cite{deBroglie1923} and Bohr's complementarity principle \cite{Bohr1928}, demonstrated that seemingly contradictory descriptions can be necessary for a complete understanding of physical reality. This was further developed in quantum mechanics through Heisenberg's uncertainty principle \cite{Heisenberg1927}. Building on this tradition, we present a new form of duality: time-mass duality. This duality suggests that the relationship between time and mass offers complementary interpretations. The conventional relativistic viewpoint with time dilation and constant rest mass can be reframed as an alternative view with absolute time and variable mass, while preserving all observable predictions.
	
	Both concepts offered in this paper provide alternative perspectives on the nature of time, energy, and quantum mechanics, while remaining internally consistent and built upon established physical principles. These dual approaches extend the wave-particle duality in a way that is both mathematically consistent and physically plausible, inviting deeper reflection on the foundations of modern physics.
	
	Our approach connects to several significant themes in fundamental physics, including Barbour's timeless formulation of dynamics \cite{Barbour1994}, Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics \cite{Rovelli1996}, and questions about the fundamental nature of spacetime in quantum gravity approaches \cite{Oriti2014}.
	
	\section{Basic Definitions and Units of the T0-Model}
	
	\subsection{Intrinsic Time Field}
	The fundamental concept of the T0-model is the intrinsic time field $\Tfield$, defined as:
	\[
	\Tfield = \frac{\hbar}{\max(mc^2, \omega)}
	\]
	with the dimension $[E^{-1}]$, where $E$ represents energy. This definition ensures that both massive particles (through $mc^2$) and massless bosons (through $\omega$) are considered in the framework.
	
	This concept builds on foundations laid by Dirac's relativistic quantum theory \cite{Dirac1928} but extends it by treating time as an intrinsic property determined by mass or energy. The idea of a characteristic timescale in quantum systems relates to the Compton time $\tau_C = \hbar/(mc^2)$ discussed by Caldirola \cite{Caldirola1976} and others as a fundamental temporal limit.
	
	\subsection{Natural Units}
	In the T0-model, we use natural units, where:
	\[
	\hbar = c = G = k_B = 1
	\]
	This simplifies the mathematical form of the equations and makes the fundamental relationships more transparent, following the tradition established by Planck \cite{Planck1899}.
	
	\subsection{Dimensionless Coupling Constants}
	In the natural units of the model, the following normalizations apply:
	\[
	\alphaEM = \alphaW = \betaT = 1
	\]
	where $\alphaEM$ is the fine structure constant, $\alphaW$ is the Wien constant, and $\betaT$ is the T-field coupling parameter.
	
	This approach of setting dimensionless constants to unity relates to the philosophical position that in the most fundamental description of nature, dimensionless constants should take simple values. This connects to Dirac's large number hypothesis \cite{Dirac1937} and discussions by Duff, Okun, and Veneziano \cite{Duff2002}.
	
	\subsection{Dimensional Analysis}
	In our model, we use energy $[E]$ as the fundamental base unit. The other physical quantities are derived as follows:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Length, Time: $[E^{-1}]$
		\item Mass, Temperature: $[E]$
		\item Charge: dimensionless when $\alphaEM = 1$
	\end{itemize}
	
	This approach builds on Einstein's recognition of the equivalence of mass and energy \cite{Einstein1905b} but takes it further by systematically reducing all physical dimensions to powers of energy.
	
	\subsection{Electromagnetic Relationships}
	In natural units:
	\[
	\varepsilon_0 = \mu_0 = 1
	\]
	and the elementary charge is given by:
	\[
	e = \sqrt{4\pi}
	\]
	when $\alphaEM = 1$ is set.
	
	This normalization was discussed by Feynman \cite{Feynman1985} and provides an elegant formulation of Maxwell's equations.
	
	\section{The $\betaT$-Parameter and Its Significance}
	
	\subsection{Definition and Basic Properties}
	The $\betaT$-parameter is a dimensionless constant that describes the coupling of the intrinsic time field $\Tfield$ to matter and vacuum energy. It plays a central role in the T0-model and connects microscopic physics with cosmological phenomena.
	
	This parameter has conceptual similarities to coupling constants in quantum field theory and modified gravity approaches \cite{Clifton2012}, though with a distinct theoretical foundation.
	
	\subsection{Characteristic Length}
	With the parameter $\xi \approx 1.33 \times 10^{-4}$, we define a characteristic length:
	\[
	r_0 = \xi \cdot l_P
	\]
	where $l_P$ is the Planck length. This sets a fundamental scale for the model.
	
	The introduction of characteristic scales below the Planck length echoes approaches in string theory \cite{Polchinski1998} but with different physical interpretation.
	
	\subsection{Transition Between Unit Systems}
	In SI units, $\betaT^{\text{SI}} \approx 0.008$, which corresponds to $\betaT^{\text{nat}} = 1$ in natural units. This conversion is important for the consistent interpretation of experimental results.
	
	\section{Field Equations of the Intrinsic Time Field}
	
	\subsection{Basic Equation}
	The field equation for the intrinsic time field $\Tfield$ is:
	\[
	\nabla^2 \Tfield = -\kappa \rho(x) \Tfield^2
	\]
	where $\kappa$ is a coupling constant with dimension $[E]$ and $\rho(x)$ represents the energy density with dimension $[E^2]$.
	
	This equation bears formal similarities to the Poisson equation in Newtonian gravity \cite{Poisson1823} and to nonlinear field equations in scalar field theories \cite{Rajaraman1982}, but with a different physical interpretation.
	
	\subsection{Gravitational Potential}
	Near massive objects, the T-field modifies the gravitational potential to:
	\[
	\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r} + \kappa r
	\]
	in SI units. The linear term $\kappa r$ explains phenomena attributed to dark energy in standard cosmology.
	
	This modified potential provides an alternative to both the MOND paradigm \cite{Milgrom1983} and dark matter theories \cite{Bertone2005} for explaining galactic rotation curves and other large-scale gravitational phenomena.
	
	\section{Conceptual Framework}
	
	\subsection{Higgs-T Interaction}
	The coupling between the Higgs field and the intrinsic time field plays a crucial role in the T0-model. This interaction provides a mechanism for mass generation that incorporates the time-mass duality at a fundamental level.
	
	This builds on the standard electroweak theory developed by Weinberg \cite{Weinberg1967} and Salam \cite{Salam1968} but incorporates the intrinsic time field as a fundamental component.
	
	\subsection{Treatment of Fermions and Bosons}
	For fermions and bosons, the standard quantum field equations are modified to include coupling to the intrinsic time field. In both cases, the T-field couples directly to the mass of the particles, leading to a mass-dependent time evolution.
	
	These modifications preserve the core structure of quantum field theory while incorporating the intrinsic time concept. They connect to Dirac's attempts to incorporate time as a dynamical variable in his relativistic wave equation \cite{Dirac1928}.
	
	\section{Cosmological Aspects}
	
	\subsection{Temperature Redshift}
	In the T0-model, cosmic background radiation is described by a modified temperature-redshift relationship:
	\[
	T(z) = T_0 (1+z)(1+\betaT \cdot \ln(1+z))
	\]
	where $T_0$ is the current temperature of the cosmic background radiation.
	
	This modification to the standard temperature-redshift relation of the $\LCDM{}$ model \cite{Peebles2003} introduces a logarithmic correction term that becomes increasingly significant at high redshifts.
	
	\subsection{Wavelength Dependence}
	The redshift shows a logarithmic dependence on wavelength:
	\[
	z(\lambda) = z_0(1+\ln(\lambda/\lambda_0))
	\]
	at $\betaT = 1$ in natural units. This relationship is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations within the framework of the T0-model.
	
	This wavelength dependence relates conceptually to varying-alpha theories \cite{Webb1999} and to certain quantum gravity phenomenological models that predict energy-dependent propagation effects \cite{AmelinoCamelia1998}.
	
	\section{Wave-Particle Duality and Its Extension}
	
	Classical quantum mechanics considers light and matter as both wave and particle, depending on the type of experiment. This duality, first proposed by de Broglie \cite{deBroglie1923} and formally articulated by Bohr \cite{Bohr1928}, remains a cornerstone of quantum theory.
	
	This work extends this duality by assuming that the wave and particle properties are determined not only by the measurement process but by a fundamental interaction with an intrinsic time structure. This intrinsic time is derived from the mass of the object under consideration and directly influences the evolution of the system.
	
	Our approach aligns with Wheeler's "it from bit" conception \cite{Wheeler1990}, suggesting that information and physical reality are intrinsically connected. It also relates to more recent approaches that question the absolute nature of time, such as the Quantum Theory of Time by Page and Wootters \cite{Page1983}.
	
	\section{Complementary Standard Model of Relativity Theory}
	
	\subsection{Introduction}
	This model is based on the assumption of an absolute time $\Tzero$ and a variable energy $E$ and mass $m$. It presents an alternative view to special relativity theory (SRT) by reinterpreting the role of time.
	
	The concept of absolute time has a long history in physics, from Newton's Principia \cite{Newton1687} to contemporary discussions in quantum gravity \cite{Anderson2010}. While Einstein's relativity \cite{Einstein1905} effectively eliminated absolute time from mainstream physics, various theoretical approaches have continued to explore its possibilities, including Lorentz's ether theory \cite{Lorentz1904}.
	
	\subsection{Basic Assumptions}
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Absolute Time: $\Tzero$ is constant.
		\item Constant Speed of Light: $c_0 \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$.
		\item Variable Energy: $E$ is not fixed, but dynamic.
		\item Mass as a Function of Energy: $m = f(E)$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These assumptions connect to the original Lorentzian interpretation of relativistic effects \cite{Lorentz1904} but differ in their implications for mass and energy.
	
	\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
	The central energy relation is:
	\[
	E = \frac{\hbar}{\Tzero}
	\]
	With the known relationship $E = m c_0^2$, we get:
	\[
	m = \frac{E}{c_0^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\Tzero c_0^2}
	\]
	This implies that mass $m$ varies with $E$, while $\Tzero$ remains fixed.
	
	\subsection{Implications for Physics}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item The classical assumption of a fixed rest mass must be extended.
		\item The model could offer alternative explanations for quantum correlations.
		\item The interpretation of time in quantum field theory might be modified.
	\end{itemize}
	
	This theory presents a complementary view to established physics and offers new approaches for unifying quantum mechanics and relativity theory. It relates conceptually to attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and relativity, including the Stueckelberg-Feynman interpretation of antiparticles \cite{Stueckelberg1941, Feynman1949}.
	
	\section{Modified Schrödinger Equation with Intrinsic Time}
	The Schrödinger equation is extended to account for a mass-dependent time. The essential change consists of replacing time $t$ in the Schrödinger equation with an intrinsic time $T$ that depends on the mass $m$ of the quantum mechanical system. The intrinsic time $T$ is defined as:
	\[
	T = \frac{\hbar}{m c^2}
	\]
	This leads to a modified Schrödinger equation in which the time evolution of the system depends on its mass. The modified formula is:
	\[
	i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial (t/T)} \Psi = \hat{H} \Psi
	\]
	
	Here, time $t$ is scaled by the intrinsic time $T$, meaning that the time evolution proceeds at different rates for different masses. For a system with a larger mass $m$, the intrinsic time $T$ is shorter, leading to faster time evolution, while for a system with a smaller mass $m$, the time evolution is slower.
	
	This modification has several interesting implications for the measurement problem in quantum mechanics \cite{Schlosshauer2005} and could offer a new perspective on quantum decoherence \cite{Zurek2003}.
	
	\section{Mathematical Comparison of Wave-Particle Duality and Time-Mass Duality}
	
	\subsection{Wave-Particle Duality}
	
	\subsubsection{Particle Description}
	The particle description of a quantum mechanical system focuses on localized mass/energy with a defined position:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Particle of mass $m$ with position $\vecx$
		\item Momentum $\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$
		\item Energy $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ (non-relativistic) or $E = \gammaf mc^2$ (relativistic)
	\end{itemize}
	
	This description has its roots in classical mechanics and was extended to the quantum domain by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics \cite{Heisenberg1925}.
	
	\subsubsection{Wave Description}
	The wave description focuses on the spatially extended wave function:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Wave function $\Psi(\vecx,t)$
		\item De Broglie wavelength $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$
		\item Wave vector $\vec{k} = \frac{\vec{p}}{\hbar}$
		\item Angular frequency $\omega = \frac{E}{\hbar}$
	\end{itemize}
	
	This description originated in optical wave theory and was brought into quantum mechanics through de Broglie's matter wave hypothesis \cite{deBroglie1923} and Schrödinger's wave mechanics \cite{Schrodinger1926}.
	
	\subsubsection{Mathematical Connection}
	The two descriptions are connected by the Fourier transformation:
	\[
	\Psi(\vecx) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3/2}} \int \phi(\vec{p}) e^{i\vec{p}\cdot\vecx/\hbar} d^3p
	\]
	\[
	\phi(\vec{p}) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3/2}} \int \Psi(\vecx) e^{-i\vec{p}\cdot\vecx/\hbar} d^3x
	\]
	where $\phi(\vec{p})$ is the wave function in momentum space.
	
	This mathematical relationship, recognized early in the development of quantum mechanics \cite{Born1926}, demonstrates how the seemingly contradictory descriptions are related.
	
	\subsection{Time-Mass Duality}
	
	\subsubsection{Time Dilation Description (Standard Model)}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Variable time $t$ with time dilation: $t' = \gammaf t$
		\item Constant rest mass $m_0$
		\item Relativistic energy: $E = \gammaf m_0c^2$
		\item Time dilation factor: $\gammaf = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$
	\end{itemize}
	
	This description corresponds to the standard interpretation of special relativity \cite{Einstein1905}, where time intervals expand for moving observers, while rest mass remains invariant. It has been empirically confirmed through numerous experiments, including muon lifetime measurements \cite{Bailey1977}.
	
	\subsubsection{Mass Variation Description (this model)}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Absolute, constant time $\Tzero$
		\item Variable mass $m = \gammaf m_0$
		\item Energy: $E = mc^2 = \frac{\hbar}{T}$
		\item Intrinsic time: $T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}$
	\end{itemize}
	
	This alternative description maintains absolute time while allowing mass to vary with velocity. It bears formal similarities to the "variable mass" interpretation occasionally used in early relativistic physics \cite{Tolman1917}, but with a fundamentally different conceptual foundation.
	
	\subsubsection{Mathematical Connection}
	The connection between both descriptions can be expressed through the following transformations:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Time coordinate transformation:
		\[
		\frac{dt}{dt_0} = \frac{m_0}{m} = \frac{1}{\gammaf}
		\]
		\item Equivalent formulation of time evolution:
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item Standard model: $i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi$
			\item This model: $i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial (t/T)}\Psi = \hat{H}\Psi$
		\end{itemize}
		\item Transformation between descriptions:
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item When $t' = \gammaf t$ (time dilation) in the standard model
			\item Then $m' = \gammaf m_0$ (mass variation) in this model
			\item With $T' = \frac{\hbar}{m'c^2} = \frac{\Tzero}{\gammaf}$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Parallels Between the Dualisms}
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item \textbf{Complementarity}: 
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item Wave-Particle: Position ($\vecx$) and momentum ($\vec{p}$) are complementary observables
			\item Time-Mass: Time ($t$ or $T$) and energy/mass ($E$ or $m$) are complementary quantities
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Uncertainty Relations}:
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item Wave-Particle: $\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$
			\item Time-Mass: $\Delta t \Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$ or $\Delta T \Delta m \geq \frac{\hbar}{2c^2}$
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Transformations}:
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
			\item Wave-Particle: Fourier transformation between position and momentum space
			\item Time-Mass: Lorentz transformation (standard model) or mass variation transformation (this model)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Mathematical Structure of Duality}
	In both cases, we can understand duality as a transformation between complementary representations of the same physical system:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item \textbf{Wave-Particle:} 
		\[
		\mathcal{F}: \Psi(\vecx) \rightarrow \phi(\vec{p})
		\]
		Where $\mathcal{F}$ is the Fourier transformation operator.
		\item \textbf{Time-Mass (in this model):} 
		\[
		\mathcal{L}: (\Tzero, m_0) \rightarrow (T, m)
		\]
		Where $\mathcal{L}$ represents a modified Lorentz transformation that causes mass variation instead of time dilation, with:
		\[
		m = \gammaf m_0
		\]
		\[
		T = \frac{\Tzero}{\gammaf}
		\]
	\end{itemize}
	The invariance in both dualisms is shown in:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Wave-Particle: $|\Psi|^2 dx = |\phi|^2 dp$ (probability conservation)
		\item Time-Mass: $m_0c^2\Tzero = mc^2T = \hbar$ (energy-time product)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	\subsection{Summary of Key Concepts}
	This paper has presented two innovative approaches to extending physical theories:
	
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item The complementary standard model of relativity with absolute time and variable mass
		\item A modified Schrödinger equation with mass-dependent intrinsic time
	\end{itemize}
	
	Both models offer new perspectives on fundamental physical concepts while maintaining mathematical consistency with established theories.
	
	\subsection{The Measurement Challenge}
	A central objection to the concept of absolute time is that we directly measure time dilation in experiments. However, our analysis shows that all such measurements -- whether with particles (muons, GPS) or light (travel time, redshift) -- can be interpreted through either perspective:
	
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Standard interpretation: variable time, constant mass
		\item T0-model interpretation: absolute time, variable mass
	\end{itemize}
	
	The mathematical equivalence between these perspectives means that experimental results can be consistently explained by either model. This situation bears resemblance to the different interpretations of quantum mechanics that maintain empirical equivalence while differing in their ontological commitments \cite{Schlosshauer2013}.
	
	\subsection{Philosophical Implications}
	The core challenge is that our measurement methods presuppose an operational definition of time linked to energy and mass ($E = h f = m c_0^2$). This makes distinguishing between the models experimentally difficult, as measurements can be interpreted dualistically.
	
	This conclusion aligns with broader philosophical discussions in the philosophy of science \cite{Kuhn1962} and the concept of theory equivalence in physics \cite{Weatherall2019}.
	
	\subsection{Future Directions}
	The Time-Mass Duality theory offers promising research avenues in:
	
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
		\item Quantum gravity
		\item Cosmology
		\item Foundational quantum mechanics
	\end{itemize}
	
	By challenging conventional understanding of time and mass while maintaining empirical adequacy, it invites deeper exploration of the fundamental concepts underlying physical theories.
