	\section{Introduction}
	
	This work develops a novel theoretical description that interprets the microscopic Casimir effect and the macroscopic cosmic microwave background (CMB) as different manifestations of an underlying vacuum structure. By introducing a characteristic vacuum length scale \( L_\xi \) and a fundamental dimensionless coupling constant \( \xi \), it is shown that both phenomena can be described by a unified theoretical framework.
	
	The theory is based on the hypothesis of a granular spacetime with a minimal length scale \( L_0 = \xi \cdot L_P \), at which all physical forces are fully effective. For distances \( d > L_0 \), only parts of these forces become visible through vacuum fluctuations, which is described by the \( 1/d^4 \) dependence of the Casimir force. Due to the extremely small size of \( L_0 \), direct experimental measurement is currently not possible, which is why the measurable scale \( L_\xi \) serves as a bridge between the fundamental spacetime structure and experimental observations. Gravity is interpreted as an emergent property of a time field, whereby cosmic effects such as the CMB can be explained without the assumption of dark energy or dark matter.
	
	\section{Theoretical Foundations}
	
	\subsection{Fundamental Length Scales}
	
	The proposed framework defines a hierarchy of characteristic length scales:
	
	\begin{align}
		L_0 &= \xi \cdot L_P \label{eq:L0_definition}\\
		L_P &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx \SI{1.616e-35}{\meter} \label{eq:planck_length}\\
		L_\xi &= \text{characteristic vacuum length scale} \approx \SI{100}{\micro\meter} \label{eq:Lxi_definition}
	\end{align}
	
	Here, \( L_0 \) represents the minimal length scale of a granular spacetime at which all vacuum fluctuations are fully effective, while \( L_\xi \) represents the emergent scale for measurable vacuum interactions.
	
	\subsection{The Coupling Constant \( \xi \)}
	
	The dimensionless coupling constant \( \xi \) is determined to be
	
	\begin{equation}
		\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4} = \num{1.333e-4} \label{eq:coupling_constant}
	\end{equation}
	
	This constant functions as a fundamental space parameter that links the granulation of spacetime at \( L_0 \) with measurable effects such as the Casimir effect and the CMB. It can be derived from a Lagrangian describing the dynamics of a time field.
	
	\section{The CMB-Vacuum Relationship}
	
	\subsection{Basic Equation}
	
	The central relationship of the theory links the energy density of the cosmic microwave background with the characteristic vacuum length scale:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\rho_{\text{CMB}} = \frac{\xi \hbar c}{L_\xi^4} \label{eq:cmb_vacuum_relation}
	\end{equation}
	
	This formula is dimensionally consistent, since
	
	\begin{equation}
		[\rho_{\text{CMB}}] = \frac{[1] \cdot [\hbar c]}{[L_\xi^4]} = \frac{\si{\joule\meter}}{\si{\meter^4}} = \si{\joule\per\meter^3}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection{Numerical Determination of \( L_\xi \)}
	
	With the experimentally determined CMB energy density \( \rho_{\text{CMB}} = \SI{4.17e-14}{\joule\per\meter^3} \), \( L_\xi \) can be calculated:
	
	\begin{align}
		L_\xi^4 &= \frac{\xi \hbar c}{\rho_{\text{CMB}}} \label{eq:Lxi_calculation}\\
		L_\xi^4 &= \frac{\num{1.333e-4} \times \SI{3.162e-26}{\joule\meter}}{\SI{4.17e-14}{\joule\per\meter^3}}\\
		L_\xi^4 &= \SI{1.011e-16}{\meter^4}\\
		L_\xi &= \SI{100}{\micro\meter} \label{eq:Lxi_result}
	\end{align}
	
	\section{Modified Casimir Theory}
	
	\subsection{Extended Casimir Formula}
	
	The Casimir effect is described by the following modified formula:
	
	\begin{equation}
		|\rho_{\text{Casimir}}(d)| = \frac{\pi^2}{240\xi} \rho_{\text{CMB}} \left( \frac{L_\xi}{d} \right)^4 \label{eq:modified_casimir}
	\end{equation}
	
	where \( d \) denotes the distance between the Casimir plates.
	
	\subsection{Consistency with the Standard Casimir Formula}
	
	By substituting the CMB-vacuum relationship \eqref{eq:cmb_vacuum_relation} into the modified Casimir formula \eqref{eq:modified_casimir}:
	
	\begin{align}
		|\rho_{\text{Casimir}}(d)| &= \frac{\pi^2}{240\xi} \cdot \frac{\xi \hbar c}{L_\xi^4} \cdot \frac{L_\xi^4}{d^4} \label{eq:casimir_substitution}\\
		&= \frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 d^4} \label{eq:standard_casimir_recovered}
	\end{align}
	
	This exactly corresponds to the established standard Casimir formula and proves the mathematical consistency of the proposed theory.
	
	\section{Numerical Verification}
	
	\subsection{Comparison Calculations}
	
	To verify the theoretical consistency, Casimir energy densities are calculated for various plate distances:
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{c S[table-format=1.3e1] S[table-format=1.2e-2] S[table-format=1.2e-2]}
			\toprule
			Distance \( d \) & {\((L_\xi/d)^4\)} & {\(\rho_{\text{Casimir}}\) (\unit{\joule\per\meter\cubed})} & {\(\rho_{\text{Casimir}}\) (\unit{\joule\per\meter\cubed})} \\
			\midrule
			\SI{1}{\micro\meter} & 1.000e8 & 1.30e-3 & 1.30e-3 \\
			\SI{100}{\nano\meter} & 1.000e12 & 1.30e1 & 1.30e1 \\
			\SI{10}{\nano\meter} & 1.000e16 & 1.30e5 & 1.30e5 \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Comparison of Casimir energy densities between standard formula and new theoretical description}
		\label{tab:casimir_comparison}
	\end{table}
	
	The perfect agreement confirms the mathematical correctness of the developed theory.
	
	\section{Physical Interpretation}
	
	\subsection{Multi-scale Vacuum Model}
	
	The developed theory implies a fundamental structure of the vacuum at different length scales:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Sub-Planck level} (\( L_0 \)): Minimal length scale of granular spacetime at which all physical forces, including vacuum fluctuations, are fully effective.
		\item \textbf{Planck threshold} (\( L_P \)): Transition region between quantum gravity and classical spacetime geometry.
		\item \textbf{Casimir manifestation} (\( L_\xi \)): Emergent length scale for measurable vacuum interactions that forms a bridge to the CMB.
		\item \textbf{Cosmic scale}: Large-scale vacuum signature through the CMB, explained by a time field from which gravity emerges.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Emergent Gravity}
	
	Gravity is interpreted as an emergent property of a time field \( \phi \), whose fluctuations at the scale \( L_0 \) create the spacetime structure. The coupling constant \( \xi \) determines the strength of these interactions, whereby cosmic effects such as the CMB can be explained without the assumption of dark energy or dark matter.
	
	\section{Summary}
	
	This work develops a novel theoretical description that interprets the Casimir effect and the cosmic microwave background as different manifestations of an underlying vacuum structure. By introducing a sub-Planck length scale \( L_0 = \xi \cdot L_P \approx \SI{2.155e-39}{\meter} \) and a characteristic vacuum length scale \( L_\xi \approx \SI{100}{\micro\meter} \), both phenomena are described in a unified mathematical framework.
	
	The theory is mathematically consistent, reproduces all established Casimir formulas exactly, and makes specific experimental predictions. The coupling constant \( \xi \) is a fundamental space parameter that can be derived from a Lagrangian with a time field. Gravity is interpreted as an emergent property of this time field, whereby cosmic effects can be explained without dark energy or dark matter.
