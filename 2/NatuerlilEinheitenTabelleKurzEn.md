### Explanation of the Einstein-Hilbert Action

The Einstein-Hilbert action holds a special position in the T0 model as it describes gravitation as a geometric property of spacetime. In natural units with G = c = 1, the Einstein-Hilbert action simplifies to:

SEH = (1/16π)∫R√(-g)d⁴x

where:
- R is the Ricci scalar (curvature scalar of spacetime)
- g is the determinant of the metric tensor gμν
- d⁴x is the four-dimensional spacetime volume element

In the T0 model, gravitation is not considered a fundamental interaction but rather an emergent phenomenon from the intrinsic time field T(x). The Einstein-Hilbert action forms the mathematical bridge between the conventional geometric description of gravitation (General Relativity) and the T0 representation with emergent gravitation.

The modified gravitational potential in the T0 model:
Φ(r) = -GM/r + κr

is directly related to the curvature of spacetime, captured in the Einstein-Hilbert action by the Ricci scalar R. The linear term κr, which is added to Newtonian gravitation in the T0 model, corresponds to a modified spacetime geometry and manifests in the Einstein-Hilbert action through modified field equations.

### Dimensional Analysis and Derivation of the Einstein-Hilbert Action in the T0 Model

#### 1. Original Form in SI Units

In general relativity, the Einstein-Hilbert action in SI units is:

SEH = (c⁴/16πG) ∫ R √(-g) d⁴x

where:
- c is the speed of light
- G is the gravitational constant
- R is the Ricci scalar with dimension [L⁻²] (curvature)
- √(-g) d⁴x is the spacetime volume element with dimension [L⁴]
- c⁴/(16πG) is the prefactor with dimension [L⁻¹ M]

The dimension of the entire action is:
[L⁻²] · [L⁴] · [L⁻¹ M] = [L M]

which corresponds to the dimension of energy × time and in SI units corresponds to the physical dimension of an action (e.g., ℏ).

#### 2. Transition to the T0 Model with Natural Units

In the T0 model, the fundamental assumptions are:
- ℏ = 1 (normalization of action)
- c = 1 (unifies space and time)
- G = 1 (unifies gravitational physics with other interactions)

With energy [E] as the base unit, the dimensions become:
- Length: [L] = [E⁻¹]
- Time: [T] = [E⁻¹]
- Mass: [M] = [E]

Therefore, the Ricci scalar R has dimension [L⁻²] = [E²]
The volume element √(-g) d⁴x has dimension [L⁴] = [E⁻⁴]
The integrand R√(-g) d⁴x thus has dimension [E²] · [E⁻⁴] = [E⁻²]

#### 3. The Prefactor in the Natural System

In the T0 model, the prefactor c⁴/(16πG) transforms to:
- In SI units, it has dimension [L⁻¹ M]
- This corresponds in natural units to [E⁻¹ · E] = [E⁰] = 1

The numerical value becomes 1/(16π) due to the normalization c = G = 1.

The action takes the form:
SEH = (1/16π) ∫ R √(-g) d⁴x

The dimension of this action in the T0 model is:
[1] · [E⁻²] · [E²] = [E⁰] = 1

#### 4. Field Equations in the T0 Model

Variation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to the field equations:
Rμν - (1/2)Rgμν = 8πTμν

where the factor 8π is derived directly from the prefactor 1/(16π) of the action. The energy-momentum tensor Tμν has dimension [E²] (energy per volume) in the T0 model.

#### 5. Connection to the Modified Gravitational Potential

The connection between the modified potential Φ(r) = -GM/r + κr and the Einstein-Hilbert action is established through the following derivation:

1. The modified potential can be represented as a solution of a modified Poisson equation:
   ```
   ∇²Φ = 4πGρ - 2κ
   ```

2. In general relativity, such a modification corresponds to an energy-momentum tensor that contains a term equivalent to a cosmological constant:
   ```
   Tμν = Tμν(Matter) + Λeff·gμν
   ```
   where Λeff = κ/G represents an effective cosmological constant.

3. This additional term in the Einstein equation corresponds to an additional term in the Einstein-Hilbert action:
   ```
   SEH = (1/16πG)∫(R - 2Λeff)√(-g)d⁴x
   ```

4. In natural units with G = 1, this becomes:
   ```
   SEH = (1/16π)∫(R - 2κ)√(-g)d⁴x
   ```

5. This modified action, when varied, leads to the field equations:
   ```
   Rμν - (1/2)Rgμν + κgμν = 8πTμν
   ```

6. In the weak field approximation, this results in the modified potential:
   ```
   ds² = -(1+2Φ)dt² + (1-2Φ)(dx² + dy² + dz²)
   ```
   with Φ(r) = -M/r + κr/2 (with G = 1).

### Connection to Observed Dark Energy

The linear term κr in the gravitational potential corresponds to an effective cosmological constant Λeff = κ/G. This has important implications for the observed dark energy:

1. The measured energy density of dark energy is approximately ρΛ ≈ 10⁻¹²³ in Planck units.

2. In the T0 model, this value emerges as a natural consequence of the parameter κ ≈ 4.8 × 10⁻¹¹ m/s²:
   ```
   ρΛ = Λeff/(8πG) = κ/(8πG²) ≈ 10⁻¹²³ mP⁴
   ```

3. This correspondence naturally solves the cosmological constant problem, as κ does not need to be fine-tuned but emerges from the fundamental structure of the T0 model:
   ```
   κ = βT · c/LT
   ```
   
   where LT is the cosmological correlation length.

This formulation explains both the observed galaxy rotation curves and cosmic acceleration without introducing additional dark components and enables direct experimental comparison with MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) and f(R) gravity theories.

This derivation shows how the linear term in the gravitational potential consistently follows from a modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action through a term proportional to the cosmological constant.

### Derivation of Gravitation in the Natural System of the T0 Model

In the T0 model, gravitation is not postulated as a fundamental property but is derived directly from the intrinsic time field T(x):

1. **Fundamental Derivation:** Gravitation arises from gradients in the intrinsic time field:
   ```
   ∇T(x) = -ℏ/(m²c²) · ∇m
   ```

2. **Connection to the Einstein-Hilbert Action:** In the natural system with ℏ = c = G = 1, it can be shown that the effective gravitational potential Φ(x) is linked to the time field by:
   ```
   Φ(x) = -ln(T(x)/T₀)
   ```
   where T₀ is a reference value of the time field.

3. **Emergent Field Equations:** The dynamics of the time field lead to modified field equations that are equivalent to a modified Einstein-Hilbert action:
   ```
   ∇²T(x) ≈ -ρ/T(x)²
   ```
   This equation is equivalent to a modified Poisson equation in the weak field limit, generating the linear term κr.

4. **Unit Relationship:** In the natural unit system of the T0 model, all terms in the Einstein-Hilbert action have dimension [E⁰], i.e., dimensionless. This results from:
   - Ricci scalar R: [E²]
   - Determinant √(-g): dimensionless
   - Volume element d⁴x: [E⁻⁴]
   - Prefactor 1/16π: dimensionless

The uniqueness of the T0 model lies in the fact that the Einstein-Hilbert action and general relativity appear as effective descriptions of gravitation, while the more fundamental description is through the intrinsic time field. This enables a unified treatment of gravitation with other interactions and explains observed anomalies in galaxy dynamics without resorting to dark matter.

## Level 3: Derived Constants with Simple Values

In the T0 model with natural units, many derived constants take remarkably simple values:

- **Compton Wavelength of the Electron** (λC,e = 1/me)
- **Rydberg Constant** (R∞ = αEM²·me/2 = me/2)
  - *Follows from the relationship R∞ = me·e⁴/(8ε₀²h³c) with αEM = 1*
- **Josephson Constant** (KJ = 2e/h = 2√4π/2π = √(4/π) ≈ 1.13)
  - *With h = 2π and e = √4π*
- **von Klitzing Constant** (RK = h/e² = 2π/4π = 1/2)
  - *With h = 2π and e² = 4π*
- **Schwinger Limit** (ES = me²c³/e√ℏ = me²)
  - *With c = ℏ = 1 and e = √4π*
- **Stefan-Boltzmann Constant** (σ = π²k₄B/(60ℏ³c²) = π²/60)
  - *With ℏ = c = kB = 1*
- **Hawking Temperature** (TH = ℏc³/(8πGMkB) = 1/(8πM))
  - *With ℏ = c = G = kB = 1*
- **Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy** (SBH = 4πGM²/(ℏc) = 4πM²)
  - *With ℏ = c = G = 1*

|------------------------|------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Planck Length (lP) | 1 | lP/r0 = 1/ξ ≈ 7519 | Base unit |
| T0 Length (r0) | r0/lP = ξ ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻⁴ | 1 | ξ · lP = λh/(32π³) · lP |
| Strong Scale | ~10⁻¹⁹ | ~10⁻¹⁵ | ~αs · λC,h |
| Higgs Length (λC,h) | ~1.6 × 10⁻²⁰ | ~1.2 × 10⁻¹⁶ | mP/mh · lP |
| Proton Radius | ~5.2 × 10⁻²⁰ | ~3.9 × 10⁻¹⁶ | ~αs/(2π) · λC,p |

| Correlation Length (LT) | ~3.9 × 10⁶² | ~2.9 × 10⁶⁶ | ~βT⁻¹/⁴ · ξ⁻¹/² · lP |

## Quantized Length Scales and Forbidden Zones

The preferred length scales in the T0 model follow the pattern:
- **Ln = lP × ∏(αi)^ni**

Where:
- αi = dimensionless constants (αEM, βT, ξ)
- ni = integer or rational exponents

### Biological Anomalies in the Length Scale Hierarchy

A remarkable discovery in the T0 model is that biological structures preferentially exist in "forbidden zones" of the length scale – regions where, according to quantization theory, no stable physical structures would normally be expected:

| Biological Structure | Typical Size | Ratio to lP | Position |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| DNA Diameter | ~2 × 10⁻⁹ m | ~10⁻²⁶ | Forbidden Zone |
| Protein | ~10⁻⁸ m | ~10⁻²⁷ | Forbidden Zone |
| Bacterium | ~10⁻⁶ m | ~10⁻²⁹ | Forbidden Zone |
| Typical Cell | ~10⁻⁵ m | ~10⁻³⁰ | Forbidden Zone |
| Multicellular Organism | ~10⁻³ – 10⁰ m | ~10⁻³² – 10⁻³⁵ | Forbidden Zone |

These "forbidden zones" lie between the preferred quantized length scales and form gaps often spanning several orders of magnitude:
- Between 10⁻³⁰ m and 10⁻²³ m (between T0 length and Compton wavelength) - ~19 orders of magnitude
- Between 10⁻⁹ m and 10⁻⁶ m (between molecular and cellular level) - ~3 orders of magnitude
- Between 10⁻³ m and 10⁰ m (macroscopic range where biological organisms dominate)

This anomaly can be explained by special stabilization mechanisms that allow biological systems to exist in these forbidden regions:

1. **Information-based Stabilization**: Biological structures utilize genetic and epigenetic information
2. **Topological Stabilization**: Biological systems often exhibit topologically protected configurations
3. **Dynamic Stabilization**: Operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium

In the T0 model, this is formalized through modified time field equations:
```
∇²T(x)bio ≈ -ρ/T(x)² + δbio(x,t)
```
where δbio represents a biological correction term that enables stability in forbidden zones.

## Practical Equivalents in Energy Units

**Important Note**: The energy unit "electron volt" (abbreviated as "eV") should not be confused with the SI unit "volt" (abbreviated as "V"). In the T0 model with natural units, the electron volt is used as the fundamental energy unit from which other units are derived.

- **Length:** (eV)⁻¹, (GeV)⁻¹, (TeV)⁻¹
- **Time:** (eV)⁻¹, (GeV)⁻¹, (TeV)⁻¹
- **Mass/Energy:** eV, MeV, GeV, TeV
- **Temperature:** eV, MeV
- **Momentum:** eV/c, GeV/c (where c=1 in natural units)
- **Cross-section:** (GeV)⁻², mb, pb, fb
- **Decay Rate:** eV, MeV

In the T0 model, length scales are often expressed as inverse energies, reflecting the fundamental relationship between energy and length in natural units (length ~ 1/energy).

## Conversion of Common SI Units to T0 Model Units

Common SI units can be reduced to energy as the base unit in the T0 model. This allows for a representation of all physical quantities in a unified system:

| SI Unit | Dimension in SI System | T0 Model Equivalent | Conversion Relationship | Typical Measurement Accuracy |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Meter (m) | [L] | [E⁻¹] | 1 m ↔ (197 MeV)⁻¹ | < 0.001% |
| Second (s) | [T] | [E⁻¹] | 1 s ↔ (6.58 × 10⁻²² MeV)⁻¹ | < 0.00001% |
| Kilogram (kg) | [M] | [E] | 1 kg ↔ 5.61 × 10²⁶ MeV | < 0.001% |
| Ampere (A) | [I] | [E] | 1 A ↔ Charge per time ↔ [E²] | < 0.005% |
| Kelvin (K) | [Θ] | [E] | 1 K ↔ 8.62 × 10⁻⁵ eV | < 0.01% |
| Volt (V) | [ML²T⁻³I⁻¹] | [E] | 1 V ↔ 1 eV/e (with e = √4π) | < 0.0001% |
| Tesla (T) | [MT⁻²I⁻¹] | [E²] | 1 T ↔ Energy per area | < 0.01% |
| Pascal (Pa) | [ML⁻¹T⁻²] | [E⁴] | 1 Pa ↔ Energy per volume | < 0.005% |
| Watt (W) | [ML²T⁻³] | [E²] | 1 W ↔ Energy per time | < 0.001% |
| Coulomb (C) | [TI] | [1] | 1 C ↔ e/√4π | < 0.0001% |
| Ohm (Ω) | [ML²T⁻³I⁻²] | [E⁻¹] | 1 Ω ↔ h/e² = 1/2 (with h=2π, e=√4π) | < 0.0000001% |
| Farad (F) | [M⁻¹L⁻²T⁴I²] | [E⁻¹] | 1 F ↔ Inverse energy | < 0.01% |
| Henry (H) | [ML²T⁻²I⁻²] | [E⁻¹] | 1 H ↔ Inverse energy | < 0.01% |

### Special Role of Electric Charge (Coulomb)

The unit Coulomb holds a special position in the T0 model as it has the most direct connection to the electromagnetic constants μ₀ and ε₀. With αEM = e²/(4πε₀ℏc) = 1 in the T0 model, it follows that:

e² = 4πε₀ℏc

Since in the T0 model ℏ = c = ε₀ = 1 is set, it follows:
e² = 4π
e = √4π ≈ 3.5

With ε₀μ₀c² = 1 and c = 1, it further follows:
ε₀μ₀ = 1

These relationships give electric charge a special significance in the T0 model. The value e = √4π is a natural consequence of the normalization αEM = 1 and is consistent with the Maxwell equations in their simplest form.

The implications of the normalization e = √4π are:
1. Electric charges are measured in units of √4π
2. Electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in pure energy units
3. The Maxwell equations take their most elegant form

This natural representation reveals the deep connection between electromagnetism and the fundamental energy structure of the universe.

## Planck Constants and Their Role in the T0 Model

The Planck constants form the fundamental basis of any natural unit system. In the T0 model, they have special significance as they serve as reference points for all other units:

| Planck Constant | Symbol | Definition in SI System | Value in T0 Model | Significance |
|------------------|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Planck Length | lP | √(ℏG/c³) | 1 | Fundamental length unit |
| Planck Time | tP | √(ℏG/c⁵) | 1 | Fundamental time unit |
| Planck Mass | mP | √(ℏc/G) | 1 | Fundamental mass unit |
| Planck Energy | EP | √(ℏc⁵/G) | 1 | Fundamental energy unit |
| Planck Temperature | TP | √(ℏc⁵/G)/kB | 1 | Fundamental temperature unit |
| Planck Pressure | pP | c⁷/(ℏG²) | 1 | Fundamental pressure unit |
| Planck Density | ρP | c⁵/(ℏG²) | 1 | Fundamental density unit |
| Planck Charge | qP | √(4πε₀ℏc) | 1 | Fundamental charge unit |

In the T0 model, all these constants are set to 1, meaning they serve as natural reference points for the corresponding physical quantities. This normalization creates a unified system in which all physical quantities can be expressed in multiples or fractions of these base units.

The special feature of the T0 model is that it not only sets the dimensional Planck constants to 1 but also dimensionless coupling constants like αEM and βT. This creates an even more unified system in which energy emerges as the fundamental unit.

## Concluding Remarks on the Completeness and Accuracy of the T0 Model

A central strength of the T0 model is that **all SI units** can be fully and precisely mapped in this system. It is not an approximate or simplified system but a more fundamental representation of physical reality.

The apparent "deviations" between measurements in the SI system and the theoretical predictions of the T0 model are not actually errors of the natural unit system but reflect inaccuracies in the measurement evaluation and the underlying metrology of the SI system. These deviations are extremely small in most cases:

| Range | Typical Deviation | Note |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Atomic Scale | ~10⁻⁹ to 10⁻⁸ | Extremely high agreement (0.0000001% - 0.000001%) |
| Nuclear Scale | ~10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁶ | Very high agreement (0.00001% - 0.0001%) |
| Macroscopic Scale | ~10⁻⁵ to 10⁻⁴ | High agreement (0.001% - 0.01%) |
| Astronomical Scale | ~10⁻³ to 10⁻² | Good agreement (0.1% - 1%) |
| Cosmological Scale | ~10⁻² to 10⁻¹ | Larger deviations (1% - 10%) |

The larger deviations at cosmological dimensions are not due to shortcomings of the T0 model but to fundamental challenges in cosmological measurement techniques and the interpretation of observational data in the context of the conventional cosmological standard model.

The T0 model with its system of natural units not only offers a mathematically more elegant and physically more fundamental framework but also enables new insights into the structure of the universe that remain hidden in the SI system. The quantized structure of length scales, the special role of biological systems, and the unified treatment of all interactions are aspects that only reveal their full significance in the T0 model.

## Comparison with Established Gravity Theories

The T0 model offers an alternative to established gravity theories and can be directly compared with them:

| Theory | Basic Principle | Modified Potential | Comparison with T0 |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Newtonian Gravitation | Force between masses | Φ(r) = -GM/r | Special case of T0 for κ=0 |
| General Relativity | Spacetime curvature | Schwarzschild solution | Phenomenologically equivalent in weak fields |
| MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) | Modified dynamics at weak acceleration | Φ(r) satisfies: ∇²Φ = 4πGρ·μ(∇Φ/a₀) | T0 provides a more fundamental basis for MOND effects |
| f(R) Theories | Modified gravitational action | Depends on specific f(R) function | T0 corresponds to f(R) = R - 2κ·G for weak fields |
| T0 Model | Emergent gravitation from time field | Φ(r) = -GM/r + κr | Unifies quantum mechanics and gravitation |

The T0 model shows the following advantages over these theories:

1. **Unified treatment of quantum and macroscopic physics** through the intrinsic time field T(x)
2. **Natural explanation for galaxy dynamics** without assuming dark matter
3. **Solution to the cosmological constant problem** by deriving κ from fundamental parameters
4. **Mathematical consistency** with quantum field theory and the standard model through modified Lagrangian densities
5. **Testable predictions** for deviations from the 1/r potential at various scales

Experimental tests to distinguish between these theories include:
- Precision measurements of the perihelion precession of planets
- Gravitational lensing effects of distant galaxies
- Satellite measurements of the Pioneer anomaly
- Observation of galaxy rotation curves of various morphologies
