	\section{Credible Alternative to GR and QFT}
	
	The Dynamic Vacuum Field Theory (DVFT) based on T0-Time-Mass Duality represents a structurally coherent and credible alternative to General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). It eliminates fundamental paradoxes and incompatibilities by allowing GR to emerge as a macroscopic geometric approximation and QFT as microscopic phase dynamics from a unified fractal vacuum structure. The entire theory is based exclusively on the single fundamental parameter \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\), enabling a minimal and parameter-free description.
	
	\subsection{Ontological Incompatibility of GR and QFT}
	
	GR describes spacetime as a dynamic, continuous and differentiable manifold, while QFT treats fields on a fixed Minkowski background, with the vacuum as a quantum fluctuating medium. These ontological differences lead to mathematical conflicts:
	
	- Renormalizability: In QFT gravity extensions, divergences like \(\propto k^4\) arise (k: wave vector in m$^{-1}$).
	- Singularities: GR produces curvature singularities (e.g., in black holes), while QFT has UV divergences (ultraviolet divergences at high energies).
	- Vacuum energy: QFT estimates vacuum energy density higher by a factor of \(10^{120}\) than that derived from cosmological observations in GR (e.g., \(\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}\) m$^{-2}$).
	
	These problems make unification impossible without additional assumptions such as extra dimensions or supersymmetry.
	
	\subsection{T0 as Unified Ontology}
	
	In T0, the vacuum is modeled as a complex scalar field:
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi(x) = \rho(x) \, e^{i \theta(x)/\xi},
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\Phi(x)\): Vacuum field (dimensionless, as normalized density),
		\item \(\rho(x)\): Amplitude field (unit: kg$^{1/2}$/m$^{3/2}$, measure of mass density),
		\item \(\theta(x)\): Phase field (dimensionless, measure of time density),
		\item \(\xi\): Fractal scale parameter (dimensionless, value \(\frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\)).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The Lagrangian density of T0 theory is:
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{L}_{\text{T0}} = K_0 (\partial_\mu \rho)^2 + B (\partial_\mu \theta)^2 + \xi \cdot \rho^2 (\partial_\mu \theta)^2 \mathcal{F} + U(\rho) + \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}},
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{T0}}\): Lagrangian density (unit: J/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(K_0\): Amplitude stiffness (unit: kg\,m$^{-4}$\,s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(B\): Phase stiffness (unit: kg\,m$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(\partial_\mu\): Partial derivative operator (unit: m$^{-1}$ or s$^{-1}$),
		\item \(\mathcal{F}\): Fractal scale function (dimensionless, e.g., \(\ln(1 + r/r_\xi)\)),
		\item \(U(\rho)\): Potential term (unit: J/m$^{3}$),
		\item \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}\): Interaction term (unit: J/m$^{3}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The derivation follows from the variation of the fractal action, where the Time-Mass Duality \(\rho \propto 1/\theta\) (from \(T \cdot m = 1\)) links the fields.
	
	Validation: The structure is UV-finite through fractal regularization and reproduces known phenomena without divergences.
	
	\subsection{Detailed Reproduction of GR}
	
	In the macroscopic limit (large scales, low energies), GR emerges from amplitude fluctuations:
	\begin{equation}
		\delta \rho = \frac{G M}{c^2 r} \cdot \xi^{-1}, \quad g = -\xi \nabla \ln \rho \approx -\frac{G M}{r^2},
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\delta \rho\): Amplitude deviation (unit: kg$^{1/2}$/m$^{3/2}$),
		\item \(G\): Gravitational constant (unit: m$^{3}$\,kg$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$),
		\item \(M\): Mass (unit: kg),
		\item \(c\): Speed of light (unit: m/s),
		\item \(r\): Distance (unit: m),
		\item \(g\): Gravitational field (unit: m/s$^{2}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	The effective metric becomes:
	\begin{equation}
		g_{00} = -1 - 2 \frac{\delta \rho}{\rho_0} = -1 + 2 \Phi_{\text{Newton}},
	\end{equation}
	where \(\Phi_{\text{Newton}}\): Newtonian potential (dimensionless).
	
	Validation: In the weak field reduces to Schwarzschild metric, consistent with perihelion shift (e.g., Mercury: 43''/century) and gravitational lensing (e.g., Einstein Cross).
	
	\subsection{Reproduction of QFT}
	
	On microscopic scales, phase dynamics dominates:
	\begin{equation}
		\Box \theta + \xi \cdot \partial_\mu (\rho^2 \partial^\mu \theta) = 0,
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\Box\): D'Alembertian operator (unit: m$^{-2}$ or s$^{-2}$).
	\end{itemize}
	
	This leads to Klein-Gordon equations for massive fields through \(\rho\)-fluctuations. Gauge symmetries emerge from phase rotations:
	\begin{equation}
		\theta \to \theta + \alpha(x),
	\end{equation}
	where \(\alpha(x)\): Local phase shift (dimensionless), reproducing U(1), SU(2), SU(3).
	
	Validation: In the high-energy limit (\(\xi \to 0\)) corresponds to standard QFT, consistent with particle accelerator data (e.g., LHC: Higgs mass 125 GeV).
	
	\subsection{Unification Without Additional Assumptions}
	
	T0 requires no quantization of gravitation, extra dimensions or supersymmetry. All constants (e.g., \(\alpha\), \(G\)) emerge from \(\xi\), and the theory is finite and singularity-free.
	
	Validation: Solves the vacuum energy discrepancy through fractal suppression (\(\rho_{\text{vac}} \propto \xi^2 \rho_{\text{crit}}\)), consistent with \(\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7\).
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	
	T0-Time-Mass Duality offers a minimal, mathematically consistent alternative to GR and QFT: both theories emerge as effective limits from fractal vacuum dynamics. The parameter freedom and the solution of fundamental conflicts make T0 a new foundation of physics, based exclusively on the geometry of the vacuum.
