CHAPTER 11: BLACK HOLE INTERIOR PREDICTION
This chapter presents a complete description of black hole interiors in the Dynamic Vacuum Field
Theory(DVFT). DVFT replaces the classical singularity of General Relativity (GR) with a finite-density
quantum vacuum core, using a nonlinear phase field θ. Both the mathematical structure and the physical
interpretation are provided.
1. DVFT Overview
DVFT treats spacetime as a quantum vacuum medium described by a complex order parameter:
Φ = ρ e^{iθ}
Gravity arises from dynamic vacuum field with amplitude ρ and phase θ. The Lagrangian contains
nonlinear kinetic terms:
L_θ = -Λ_v + (ρ_0/2)X - (η/(3 a_0^2)) X^{3/2}
with X = -g^{μν} ∂_μθ ∂_νθ.
At large accelerations (g >> a_0), DVFT reduces to GR. At small accelerations (g << a_0), nonlinearities
appear.
2. Black Hole Metric and Field Ansatz
We use the standard static spherically symmetric metric:
ds² = -e^{2Φ(r)}dt² + dr²/(1 - 2Gm(r)/r) + r² dΩ².

The vacuum phase depends only on radius: θ = θ(r). The kinetic invariant becomes:
X = -(1 - 2Gm(r)/r) θ'(r)².
From the k-essence stress-energy tensor:
T_{μν} = 2 L_X ∂_μθ ∂_νθ - g_{μν} L_θ
3. Stress-Energy Components
Define:
L_θ = -Λ_v + (ρ_0/2)X - (η/(3 a_0²)) X^{3/2},
L_X = ∂L_θ/∂X = ρ_0/2 - (η/(2a_0²)) X^{1/2}.
Energy density and pressures:
ρ = L_θ,
p_t = ρ,
p_r = 2 L_X X - L_θ.
This anisotropic vacuum structure is crucial for stabilizing the interior.
4. Vacuum Saturation Mechanism
The scalar field equation ∇_μ(L_X ∂^μθ)=0 is satisfied in the core when:
L_X(X_0) = 0.
Setting L_X=0 gives:
X_0^{1/2} = (ρ_0 a_0²)/η.
Thus, the vacuum phase reaches a 'saturation' point X_0, limiting further compression. The core energy
density becomes finite:
ρ_core = -Λ_v + (ρ_0³ a_0⁴)/(6 η²).
5. Core Geometry
With ρ = ρ_core = constant, the Einstein equation gives a de Sitter–like interior:
m(r) = (4π/3)ρ_core r³,
1 - 2Gm(r)/r = 1 - (8πG/3)ρ_core r².
Thus, the interior metric is:
ds²_core ≈ -[1 - (Λ_eff r²)/3] dt² + dr²/[1 - (Λ_eff r²)/3] + r² dΩ²,
with Λ_eff = 8πG ρ_core.
There is no singularity; curvature remains finite.
6. Matching to Exterior Geometry
For r > r_c (core radius), X << X_0 and nonlinear effects vanish. DVFT reduces to GR:
ds² ≈ Schwarzschild metric.
Matching conditions ensure:
g_{tt}(core) = g_{tt}(ext),
g_{rr}(core) = g_{rr}(ext).
Thus, DVFT describes a black hole with a GR exterior and a finite-density vacuum core interior.
7. Physical Interpretation (Non-Mathematical)
• GR predicts infinite collapse. DVFT prevents this by saturating the vacuum phase.
• The black hole interior becomes a finite-size 'quantum core.'
• As mass falls in, both the horizon and the core radius increase.
• No singularity exists. Space cannot compress indefinitely.
• The final object is a quantum vacuum condensate, not a point of infinite density.

Depending on parameters (ρ_0, η, a_0):
1. Stable quantum object: evaporation slows, horizon stalls, core remains.
2. Horizon shrinks until it meets the core, leaving a compact vacuum star.
3. Complete evaporation: horizon vanishes; core dissolves smoothly.
In all cases, there is no singularity and no information loss.
Conclusion
DVFT gives the first consistent picture of a black hole interior using a single phase field. It provides:
• GR-like exterior geometry,
• A finite-density quantum core replacing the singularity,
• A mechanism for black hole growth and evolution,
• A plausible resolution of the information paradox.
This bridges the gap between GR and QFT by treating vacuum as a physical, compressible quantum
medium.


\section*{T0 Theory Integration}
This chapter integrates DVFT concepts with T0 Time-Mass Duality Theory, where the fundamental relation $T(x,t) \cdot m(x,t) = 1$ governs all vacuum field dynamics. The vacuum amplitude $\rho$ is directly related to local time $T$ through $\rho \propto 1/T$.
