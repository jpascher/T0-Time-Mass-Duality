CHAPTER 10: DARK ENERGY REINTERPRETATION
1. Introduction
This document presents a strict DVFT-based derivation of dark energy, with no reference to external darkenergy models. The goal is to show how cosmic acceleration arises solely from the vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0) ρ
and its microphysical potential U(ρ).
We derive the full equations for DVFT dark energy, specify U(ρ) from the DVFT micro-lattice model,
and compare DVFT predictions directly with observed cosmological values.
Fundamental DVFT vacuum field:
Φ(x,t) = ρ(x,t) e^{iθ(x,t)}.
The universe’s large-scale behavior emerges from the homogeneous evolution of ρ(t), while θ(t) controls
quantum-phase structure.
2. DVFT Vacuum Lagrangian in a Homogeneous Universe
From DVFT microphysics, the effective continuum vacuum Lagrangian is:
𝓛_vac = (A_ρ/2)(\partial_t ρ)^2 - (B_ρ/2)|\nablaρ|^2 + (A_θ/2)ρ^2(\partial_t θ)^2 - (B_θ/2)ρ^2|\nablaθ|^2 - U(ρ).
For a homogeneous FRW universe (ρ(t), θ(t), \nablaρ = \nablaθ = 0):
𝓛_hom = (A_ρ/2)ρ̇^2 + (A_θ/2)ρ^2 θ̇^2 - U(ρ).
All cosmological dark-energy effects will arise directly from this expression. No additional fluids or fields
are introduced.
3. Vacuum Energy Density and Pressure from DVFT
Define kinetic energy of the vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0)–phase system:
K = (A_ρ/2)ρ̇^2 + (A_θ/2)ρ^2 θ̇^2.
DVFT vacuum behaves as a perfect fluid with:
ρ_DVFT = K + U(ρ),
p_DVFT = K - U(ρ).
The effective equation-of-state is:
w_DVFT = (K - U) / (K + U).
Important limits:
\textbullet{} K ≪ U \rightarrow w \rightarrow -1 (dark-energy–like)
\textbullet{} K ~ U \rightarrow -1 < w < -1/3 (dynamical dark energy)
\textbullet{} K ≫ U \rightarrow w \rightarrow +1 (stiff fluid; irrelevant today)
4. Dark-Energy Evolution Equation in DVFT
Varying the homogeneous action yields the amplitude evolution equation:
A_ρ(ρ̈+ 3Hρ̇) - A_θρ θ̇^2 + dU/dρ = 0,
where:
H = ȧ/a (Hubble parameter).
At late times, the cosmic phase tends to freeze on large scales (θ̇ \approx 0), reducing the equation to:
A_ρ(ρ̈+ 3Hρ̇) + dU/dρ = 0.

This is the DVFT dark-energy equation: the cosmic vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0) ρ evolves in its potential U(ρ)
under Hubble damping.
5. Microphysical Form of U(ρ) in DVFT
DVFT is based on a micro-lattice vacuum with local Hamiltonian:
H_loc = p_ρ^2/(2M_ρ) + p_θ^2/(2M_θ ρ^2) + U_loc(ρ).
DVFT microphysics requires U_loc(ρ) to have:
\textbullet{} a stable minimum at ρ_0 (preferred vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0)),
\textbullet{} positive curvature at ρ_0 (vacuum stiffness),
\textbullet{} anharmonic corrections stabilizing deviations.
Thus the coarse-grained continuum potential becomes:
U(ρ) = Λ_0 + (κ/2)(ρ - ρ_0)^2 + (λ/4)(ρ - ρ_0)^4 + …
Where:
\textbullet{} Λ_0 = microphysical residual vacuum energy density,
\textbullet{} κ = vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0) compressibility,
\textbullet{} λ = higher-order stabilization.
Near the minimum:
U(ρ) \approx Λ_0 + (1/2)m_ρ^2 (ρ - ρ_0)^2,
with m_ρ^2 = κ/A_ρ.
This U(ρ) is not arbitrary; it is derived from DVFT vacuum elasticity and amplitude stability.
6. DVFT Explanation for Dark Energy on Cosmic Scales
DVFT predicts dark energy because:
1. The vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0) ρ has a preferred value ρ_0 (microphysical equilibrium).
2. The local vacuum energy density U(ρ_0) = Λ_0 is *not zero*.
3. On large scales, ρ(t) approaches ρ_0 and remains nearly constant due to strong Hubble damping.
4. Therefore, the vacuum behaves like a nearly constant energy density with w \approx -1.
The measured value:
ρ_Λ \approx 7 \times 10⁻^2^7 kg/m^3
Ω_Λ \approx 0.70–0.75
matches DVFT if:
Λ_0 = U(ρ_0) \approx 0.7 ρ_crit.
Thus dark energy is the “elastic offset energy of the vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0)”
7. Why U(ρ) Is Negligible on Solar and Galactic Scales
A uniform vacuum energy density produces acceleration:
g_vac(r) \approx (8πG/3) ρ_Λ r.
At solar scale (r = 1 AU):
g_vac ~ 10⁻^2^4 m/s^2 (negligible).
At galactic scale (r = 10 kpc):
g_vac ~ 10⁻^1^6 m/s^2 (still negligible).
Thus:
\textbullet{} Local dynamics are governed by \nablaρ and matter coupling, not U(ρ).
\textbullet{} Vacuum elasticity only influences cosmic expansion where r ~ gigaparsecs.
DVFT cleanly separates:
\textbullet{} Galactic gravity: amplitude gradients \nablaρ dominate.

IJFMR250664112 Volume 7, Issue 6, November-December 2025 26
\textbullet{} Cosmological acceleration: homogeneous U(ρ_0) dominates.
8. Numerical Comparison with Observations
Given:
\textbullet{} H_0 \approx 67–70 km/s/Mpc,
\textbullet{} ρ_crit = 3H_0^2/(8πG),
\textbullet{} Ω_Λ \approx 0.7,
DVFT requires:
U(ρ_0) = Λ_0 \approx 0.7 ρ_crit.
This matches observational values from CMB, BAO, and SN data.
Moreover, if ρ(t) is still slowly relaxing toward ρ_0, then:
w_DVFT \approx -1 + 2K/U,
allowing mild deviations from -1 (observationally allowed), and potentially matching evolving darkenergy hints from DESI.
9. Summary
From strict DVFT principles, dark energy arises from the vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0)’s microphysical potential:
U(ρ) = Λ_0 + (κ/2)(ρ - ρ_0)^2 + (λ/4)(ρ - ρ_0)^4 + …
Key results:
\textbullet{} ρ_DVFT = K + U(ρ), p_DVFT = K - U(ρ).
\textbullet{} w_DVFT = (K - U)/(K + U).
\textbullet{} Vacuum amplitude evolves via A_ρ(ρ̈+ 3Hρ̇) + U'(ρ) = 0.
\textbullet{} On cosmic scales, ρ \approx ρ_0 \Rightarrow w \approx -1, matching dark-energy observations.
\textbullet{} On solar/galactic scales, U(ρ) is negligible; \nablaρ dominates gravity.
\textbullet{} DVFT dark energy matches measured values Ω_Λ \approx 0.7 and w \approx -1 with no additional fields.
Thus DVFT naturally unifies local gravity and cosmic acceleration using only vacuum amplitude ($\\rho_0 = 1/\\xi^2$ from T0) physics.


\section*{T0 Theory Integration}
This chapter integrates DVFT concepts with T0 Time-Mass Duality Theory, where the fundamental relation $T(x,t) \cdot m(x,t) = 1$ governs all vacuum field dynamics. The vacuum amplitude $\rho$ is directly related to local time $T$ through $\rho \propto 1/T$.
