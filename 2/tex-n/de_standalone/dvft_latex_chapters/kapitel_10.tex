DARK ENERGY REINTERPRETATION
1. Introduction
This document presents a strict DVFT-based derivation of dark energy, with no reference to external darkenergy models. The goal is to show how cosmic acceleration arises solely from the vacuum amplitude \rho
and its microphysical potential U(\rho).
We derive the full equations for DVFT dark energy, specify U(\rho) from the DVFT micro-lattice model,
and compare DVFT predictions directly with observed cosmological values.
Fundamental DVFT vacuum field:
\Phi(x,t) = \rho(x,t) e^{i\theta(x,t)}.
The universe’s large-scale behavior emerges from the homogeneous evolution of \rho(t), while \theta(t) controls
quantum-phase structure.
2. DVFT Vacuum Lagrangian in a Homogeneous Universe
From DVFT microphysics, the effective continuum vacuum Lagrangian is:
𝓛_vac = (A_\rho/2)(\partial_t \rho)$^2$ - (B_\rho/2)|\nabla\rho|$^2$ + (A_\theta/2)\rho$^2$(\partial_t \theta)$^2$ - (B_\theta/2)\rho$^2$|\nabla\theta|$^2$ - U(\rho).
For a homogeneous FRW universe (\rho(t), \theta(t), \nabla\rho = \nabla\$theta = 0$):
𝓛_hom = (A_\rho/2)\rhȯ$^2$ + (A_\theta/2)\rho$^2$ \thetȧ$^2$ - U(\rho).
All cosmological dark-energy effects will arise directly from this expression. No additional fluids or fields
are introduced.
3. Vacuum Energy Density and Pressure from DVFT
Define kinetic energy of the vacuum amplitude–phase system:
K = (A_\rho/2)\rhȯ$^2$ + (A_\theta/2)\rho$^2$ \thetȧ$^2$.
DVFT vacuum behaves as a perfect fluid with:
\rho_DVFT = K + U(\rho),
p_DVFT = K - U(\rho).
The effective equation-of-state is:
w_DVFT = (K - U) / (K + U).
Important limits:
• K ≪ U \to w \to -1 (dark-energy–like)
• K ~ U \to -1 < w < -1/3 (dynamical dark energy)
• K ≫ U \to w \to +1 (stiff fluid; irrelevant today)
4. Dark-Energy Evolution Equation in DVFT
Varying the homogeneous action yields the amplitude evolution equation:
A_\rho(\rhö+ 3H\rhȯ) - A_\theta\rho \thetȧ$^2$ + dU/d\$rho = 0$,
where:
H = ȧ/a (Hubble parameter).
At late times, the cosmic phase tends to freeze on large scales (\thetȧ \approx 0), reducing the equation to:
A_\rho(\rhö+ 3H\rhȯ) + dU/d\$rho = 0$.

This is the DVFT dark-energy equation: the cosmic vacuum amplitude \rho evolves in its potential U(\rho)
under Hubble damping.
5. Microphysical Form of U(\rho) in DVFT
DVFT is based on a micro-lattice vacuum with local Hamiltonian:
H_loc = p_\rho$^2$/(2M_\rho) + p_\theta$^2$/(2M_\theta \rho$^2$) + U_loc(\rho).
DVFT microphysics requires U_loc(\rho) to have:
• a stable minimum at \rho$_0$ (preferred vacuum amplitude),
• positive curvature at \rho$_0$ (vacuum stiffness),
• anharmonic corrections stabilizing deviations.
Thus the coarse-grained continuum potential becomes:
U(\rho) = Λ$_0$ + (κ/2)(\rho - \rho$_0$)$^2$ + (\lambda/4)(\rho - \rho$_0$)⁴ + …
Where:
• Λ$_0$ = microphysical residual vacuum energy density,
• κ = vacuum amplitude compressibility,
• \$lambda = higher$-order stabilization.
Near the minimum:
U(\rho) \approx Λ$_0$ + (1/2)m_\rho$^2$ (\rho - \rho$_0$)$^2$,
with m_\rho$^2$ = κ/A_\rho.
This U(\rho) is not arbitrary; it is derived from DVFT vacuum elasticity and amplitude stability.
6. DVFT Explanation for Dark Energy on Cosmic Scales
DVFT predicts dark energy because:
1. The vacuum amplitude \rho has a preferred value \rho$_0$ (microphysical equilibrium).
2. The local vacuum energy density U(\rho$_0$) = Λ$_0$ is *not zero*.
3. On large scales, \rho(t) approaches \rho$_0$ and remains nearly constant due to strong Hubble damping.
4. Therefore, the vacuum behaves like a nearly constant energy density with w \approx -1.
The measured value:
\rho_Λ \approx 7 \times 10⁻$^2$⁷ kg/m$^3$
\Omega_Λ \approx 0.70–0.75
matches DVFT if:
Λ$_0$ = U(\rho$_0$) \approx 0.7 \rho_crit.
Thus dark energy is the “elastic offset energy of the vacuum amplitude”
7. Why U(\rho) Is Negligible on Solar and Galactic Scales
A uniform vacuum energy density produces acceleration:
g_vac(r) \approx (8\piG/3) \rho_Λ r.
At solar scale ($r = 1$ AU):
g_vac ~ 10⁻$^2$⁴ m/s$^2$ (negligible).
At galactic scale ($r = 10$ kpc):
g_vac ~ 10⁻¹⁶ m/s$^2$ (still negligible).
Thus:
• Local dynamics are governed by \nabla\rho and matter coupling, not U(\rho).
• Vacuum elasticity only influences cosmic expansion where r ~ gigaparsecs.
DVFT cleanly separates:
• Galactic gravity: amplitude gradients \nabla\rho dominate.

• Cosmological acceleration: homogeneous U(\rho$_0$) dominates.
8. Numerical Comparison with Observations
Given:
• H$_0$ \approx 67–70 km/s/Mpc,
• \rho_crit = 3H$_0$$^2$/(8\piG),
• \Omega_Λ \approx 0.7,
DVFT requires:
U(\rho$_0$) = Λ$_0$ \approx 0.7 \rho_crit.
This matches observational values from CMB, BAO, and SN data.
Moreover, if \rho(t) is still slowly relaxing toward \rho$_0$, then:
w_DVFT \approx -1 + 2K/U,
allowing mild deviations from -1 (observationally allowed), and potentially matching evolving darkenergy hints from DESI.
9. Summary
From strict DVFT principles, dark energy arises from the vacuum amplitude’s microphysical potential:
U(\rho) = Λ$_0$ + (κ/2)(\rho - \rho$_0$)$^2$ + (\lambda/4)(\rho - \rho$_0$)⁴ + …
Key results:
• \rho_DVFT = K + U(\rho), p_DVFT = K - U(\rho).
• w_DVFT = (K - U)/(K + U).
• Vacuum amplitude evolves via A_\rho(\rhö+ 3H\rhȯ) + U'(\rho) = 0.
• On cosmic scales, \rho \approx \rho$_0$ \Rightarrow w \approx -1, matching dark-energy observations.
• On solar/galactic scales, U(\rho) is negligible; \nabla\rho dominates gravity.
• DVFT dark energy matches measured values \Omega_Λ \approx 0.7 and w \approx -1 with no additional fields.
Thus DVFT naturally unifies local gravity and cosmic acceleration using only vacuum amplitude physics.
