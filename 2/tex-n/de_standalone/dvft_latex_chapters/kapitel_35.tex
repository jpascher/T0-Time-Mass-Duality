QUANTUM PHENOMENA EXPLAINED
DVFT interprets quantum mechanics as the behavior of vacuum-phase and vacuum-amplitude fields. This
chapter provides a unified explanation for twelve major unsolved quantum phenomena, including collapse,
entanglement, zero point energy, decoherence and delayed-choice experiments. DVFT clarifies these
phenomena by grounding them in the physical fields \Phi = \rho e^{i\theta}.
1. Wavefunction Collapse
In DVFT, collapse is not a postulate. It occurs when vacuum-phase coherence (\theta) is disrupted by
macroscopic interactions. Measurement destroys \theta-coherence, forcing ψ to localize.
2. Wave–Particle Duality
Waves correspond to coherent vacuum-phase patterns, while particles correspond to localized vacuumamplitude excitations. Duality becomes a property of \Phi, not a paradox.
3. Entanglement
Entanglement arises from shared vacuum-phase coherence between separated systems. Global coherence
of \theta allows nonlocal correlations without signaling.
4. Zero-Point Energy

Dynamic vacuum field gives finite, physical zero-point energy \varepsilon_vac = \rho_0^2 (d\theta/dt)^2, connecting vacuum
energy to cosmological acceleration.
5. Delayed Choice & Quantum Eraser
Interference depends on \theta-coherence. Which-path detectors scramble \theta; erasure restores it. DVFT removes
retrocausality by explaining phase re-coherence.
6. Decoherence
Decoherence is vacuum-phase scrambling. Macroscopic systems distort \theta-fields and eliminate
interference patterns physically, not abstractly.
7. Quantum Randomness
Randomness arises from unavoidable vacuum-phase fluctuations: Δ\theta \cdot ΔE \geq \hbar/2 produces inherent phase
jitter in \Phi.
8. Atomic Quantization
Energy quantization corresponds to \theta-field circulation conditions: ∮ \nabla\theta \cdot dl = 2\pin. Atomic spectra reflect
dynamic vacuum field waves.
Conclusion
DVFT unifies gravity and quantum mechanics by grounding quantum behavior in vacuum-phase
properties. Interference, collapse, entanglement, and decoherence all follow naturally from \Phi = \rho e^{i\theta}.
