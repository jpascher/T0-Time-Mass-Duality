PROBLEMS IN GENERAL RELATIVITY
General Relativity (GR) is a mathematically beautiful theory, but it lacks a physical substrate and fails in
extreme regimes---producing singularities, requiring unobserved matter, and offering no mechanism for
cosmic inflation or dark energy. The Dynamic Vacuum Field Theory (DVFT) replaces these gaps by
modeling spacetime as a dynamic vacuum field. This chapter summarizes the major problems of GR and
how DVFT provides deeper, physical, and internally consistent solutions.
The existence of a dynamic vacuum field introduces a dynamical character to spacetime itself. Though
\varphivac breaks global time-translation symmetry at the solution level, the underlying Lagrangian remains
Lorentz invariant. Every observer perceives \varphivac as the same dynamic vacuum field state in their frame
of reference.
1. Origin of the Curvature
The vacuum field carries energy--momentum. Its stress--energy tensor directly enters Einstein's equation.
Thus, curvature is caused by the vacuum’s internal dynamics. Curvature is not a mysterious property of
geometry but a macroscopic field response to dynamic vacuum field distortions. DVFT derives curvature
from dynamics. Distorted dynamic vacuum field carries stress--energy:
T\muν(\varphi) = $\partial$\mu\varphi* $\partial$ν\varphi + $\partial$\mu\varphi $\partial$ν\varphi* − g\muν(\ldots{})
Phase gradients \delta\theta propagate at light speed, modifying T\muν(\varphi). Einstein's GR equation then becomes:
G\muν = 8\piG ( T\muν (m) + T\muν(\varphi))
The gravitational potential is emergent from the vacuum phase pattern. Thus, curvature is the macroscopic
imprint of dynamic vacuum field structure. Mass perturbs the phase; phase distortions propagate outward;
their energy--momentum curves spacetime. This explains why curvature forms at a distance in a causal
manner and why gravitational changes propagate at c.
2. Curvature Without Physical Cause
GR states that curvature is determined by the Einstein equation G_{\muν} = 8\piGT_{\muν}, but it does not
explain what actually curves. DVFT explains curvature as the stress--energy of the dynamic vacuum field,
where phase gradients $\partial$\theta create gravitational curvature. Dynamics provides a physical mechanism for
gravity.
3. Black Hole Singularity Resolution
Classical GR predicts singularities where curvature diverges to infinity. Such infinities signal a breakdown
of the theory. In DVFT, the vacuum field \varphi cannot support infinite phase gradients due to nonlinear
saturation in its potential V(|\varphi|\textsuperscript{2}). As a collapsing object approaches the classical singularity, the vacuum
amplitude \rho decreases while the phase gradient $\partial$\theta increases but never diverges. The phase reaches a
saturation limit determined by vacuum stiffness, preventing infinite curvature:
|$\partial$\theta| < \thetamax
The center of a black hole becomes a phase defect of \varphi rather than a point of infinite density. This behavior
mirrors topological defects in superfluid and field-theory solitons.
Thus, DVFT naturally resolves singularities by replacing them with finite-energy vacuum-phase defects,
maintaining causality and finiteness of curvature.
DVFT introduces field dynamics that restrict infinitely large gradients by physical vacuum stiffness.
4. Big Bang Singularity Resolution
GR cannot describe the origin of the universe because the Big Bang is a singularity. DVFT replaces it with
a vacuum phase transition from \rho  $\approx$  0 to \rho$_0$, producing inflation, reheating, and the origin of space and time
without infinities.

5. No Explanation for Inflation
GR needs an ad-hoc inflation field. DVFT naturally generates inflation from the vacuum potential V(\rho)
and the intrinsic phase \theta(t). Slow-roll expansion is built into the dynamics, making inflation inevitable.
6. Dark Matter Problem
GR requires unseen matter to explain galaxy rotation curves, lensing, and cluster masses. DVFT explains
these effects through long-range vacuum-phase distortions which create additional curvature, producing
dark-matter-like behavior without introducing new particles.
7. Dark Energy
GR’s cosmological constant problem arises from a mismatch of 120 orders of magnitude. DVFT attributes
dark energy to residual dynamic vacuum field energy, \varepsilon_vac = \rho$_0$\textsuperscript{2}\thetȧ\textsuperscript{2} + V(\rho$_0$), providing a natural physical
source of accelerated expansion.
8. No Mechanism for Expansion of Space
GR describes expansion mathematically but does not explain why it occurs. DVFT explains expansion
through vacuum amplitude growth \rho(t) controls the scale factor a(t). Space expands because the vacuum
evolves.
9. Why Gravity is Always Attractive
GR postulates attraction but does not explain it. DVFT explains attraction through vacuum phase tension:
mass distorts phase gradients, and objects move along paths minimizing vacuum energy.
Conclusion
DVFT resolves every major theoretical limitation of General Relativity by introducing a dynamic vacuum
field whose amplitude and phase structure create curvature, remove singularities and explain cosmic
expansion.
