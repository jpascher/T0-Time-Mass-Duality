STRONG, WEAK, AND DEEP FIELD PHYSICS
1. Introduction
Dynamic Vacuum Field Theory (DVFT) predicts distinct regimes of gravitational behavior determined by
the magnitude of the vacuum phase gradient
X = -g^{\muν} \partial\mu\theta \partialν\theta.
These regimes—strong field, weak field, deep field, and an ultra-deep cosmological regime—correspond
to different nonlinear responses of the vacuum. This chapter provides a unified description of vacuum
behavior from local strong-gravity environments to the largest cosmological scales where dark energy
dominates.
2. Strong Field Regime (X >> a_0^2)
In high-acceleration environments such as near stellar surfaces, neutron stars, or black hole exteriors,
phase gradients are large. The vacuum response
L_X = \partialL_\theta/\partialX
approaches an almost constant value:
L_X \approx \rho_0/2.
Nonlinear terms in the Lagrangian,

L_\theta = (\rho_0/2) X - (η/(3 a_0^2)) X^{3/2} - Λ_v,
become negligible compared to the linear X term. In this limit DVFT reduces to the predictions of General
Relativity with an effective cosmological constant Λ_eff set by the residual vacuum term. Curvature is
dominated by the quasi-linear response of \theta, and conventional GR tests are satisfied.
3. Weak Field Regime (X ~ a_0^2)
As accelerations approach a_0, nonlinear vacuum effects begin to contribute. Here X is comparable to a_0^2
and the X^{3/2} correction in the Lagrangian becomes relevant. The response function
L_X = \rho_0/2 - (η/(2 a_0^2)) X^{1/2}
departs from a constant and begins to depend on the local phase gradient. Observable consequences
include:
• small deviations from Newtonian potential in extended systems,
• mild corrections to post-Newtonian parameters,
• subtle modifications to gravitational lensing and Shapiro delay.
This regime provides a smooth transition between pure GR behavior in strong fields and the deep field
behavior that governs galactic outskirts.
4. Deep Field Regime (X << a_0^2, Galactic Scale)
The deep field regime governs low-acceleration environments such as the outskirts of spiral galaxies. In
this limit phase gradients are small, but the nonlinear X^{3/2} term dominates the response of the vacuum.
Integrating out the amplitude \rho and enforcing scale invariance leads to an effective vacuum energy density
scaling as:
E_vac ∝ |\nabla\varphi|^3,
where \varphi is the gravitational potential related to \theta through the background dynamic vacuum field. The
resulting field equation in the non-relativistic limit becomes:
\nabla · [(|\nabla\varphi|/a_0) \nabla\varphi] = 4\piG \rho_b,
where \rho_b is the baryonic matter density. For spherical systems this gives:
g^2(r) = a_0 g_N(r),
with g the true gravitational acceleration and g_N the Newtonian acceleration from baryons alone. This
produces:
• flat rotation curves,
• the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation v_c⁴ = G M_b a_0,
• no requirement for dark matter halos.
Thus the deep field regime is responsible for MOND-like behavior emerging naturally from DVFT
vacuum microphysics.
5. Ultra-Deep Cosmological Regime (g << a_0, Dark Energy Scale)
On scales comparable to or larger than the Hubble radius, typical gravitational accelerations become far
smaller than a_0. In this ultra-deep regime, phase gradients are extremely small and the kinetic contributions
in L_\theta are suppressed relative to the residual vacuum term. The vacuum field approaches:
\Phi \approx \rho_\infty e^{i \mu t},
with \rho_\infty a nearly homogeneous amplitude and \mu the dynamic vacuum field frequency. The effective
energy density and pressure of the vacuum become:
\varepsilon_vac \approx \rho_\infty^2 \mu^2 + V(\rho_\infty),
p_vac \approx \rho_\infty^2 \mu^2 - V(\rho_\infty),

where V(\rho) is the vacuum potential. For parameter choices where V(\rho_\infty) dominates over the kinetic term,
one obtains:
p_vac \approx -\varepsilon_vac,
which corresponds to an equation of state parameter w \approx -1. This is the dark-energy-like regime of DVFT:
the universe is driven by residual dynamic vacuum field energy and the nearly constant vacuum potential.
In this ultra-deep regime:
• X \rightarrow 0,
• L_X \rightarrow \rho_0/2,
• the stress–energy tensor of \theta reduces to an effective cosmological constant term,
• the Friedmann equations predict accelerated expansion.
Thus, dark energy is not an independent fluid but the asymptotic vacuum state of \Phi when typical
gravitational gradients fall far below a_0 on cosmological scales.
6. Transitions Across Scales
The three local regimes (strong, weak, deep) and the ultra-deep cosmological regime are not separate
theories; they are different limits of the same underlying dynamics controlled by X and the parameters (\rho_0,
η, a_0, Λ_v). As a characteristic acceleration in a system changes, the vacuum smoothly interpolates
between:
• GR-like behavior in compact objects and Solar System tests,
• modified dynamics in galaxies (deep field),
• effective dark energy at horizon-scale averages (ultra-deep field).
The governing equation
\nabla_\mu (L_X \nabla^\mu \theta) = 0
determines how the phase field adjusts across these regimes. Small, local systems never probe the ultradeep vacuum; galaxies probe the deep-field regime; the universe as a whole samples the full vacuum
potential and residual dynamic vacuum field energy.
7. Implications for Cosmology and Structure Formation
Because the same Lagrangian L_\theta governs all regimes, DVFT ties together:
• galactic rotation curves,
• cluster dynamics,
• cosmic acceleration,
• the absence of singularities,
• with a single set of vacuum parameters. Structure formation proceeds in a background where:
• early universe: kinetic and potential terms of \Phi drive inflation-like expansion,
• intermediate epochs: matter dominates and deep-field corrections shape halo dynamics,
• late universe: ultra-deep regime emerges, and dark-energy-like behavior dominates.
In contrast to ΛCDM, where dark matter and dark energy are independent components, DVFT describes
both as manifestations of one vacuum field, viewed in different acceleration regimes.
8. Summary
DVFT organizes gravitational behavior into four coherent regimes:
• Strong field: GR limit, X >> a_0^2, linear response, compact objects.
• Weak field: transitional, X ~ a_0^2, small nonlinear corrections.
• Deep field: galactic scale, X << a_0^2 but gradients still relevant, g^2 = a_0 g_N, no dark matter.

• Ultra-deep cosmological field: g << a_0 on horizon scales, residual vacuum energy acts as dark energy (w
\approx -1).
This regime structure is not an artificial phenomenology; it is the natural consequence of a single dynamic
vacuum field Lagrangian. As a result, DVFT provides a unified physical explanation for local gravity tests,
galaxy dynamics, and late-time cosmic acceleration within one coherent framework.
