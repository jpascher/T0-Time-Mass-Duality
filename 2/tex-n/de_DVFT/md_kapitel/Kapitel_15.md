the high-acceleration regime of the Solar System, FFGFT reduces to a Newtonian potential plus a tiny 1/r³
correction generated by the θ-field dynamics. This correction leads to the correct 43 arcsec/century
precession.
2. FFGFT in the Solar System: High-Acceleration Limit
FFGFT describes gravity as arising from convergence of a vacuum phase field θ. Its Lagrangian contains
nonlinear terms:
L_θ = -Λ_v + (ρ₀/2)X - (η/(3 a₀²)) X^{3/2},
with X = -g^{μν} ∂_μθ ∂_νθ.
In the Solar System, gravitational acceleration is much larger than a₀ (~10⁻¹⁰ m/s²):
g / a₀ ~ 10⁹.
Thus, nonlinear MOND/FFGFT corrections vanish. FFGFT reduces to a GR-like weak-field theory,
predicting an effective potential of the form:
U_eff(r) = -GMm/r + L²/(2mr²) - GM L²/(mc² r³).
3. FFGFT Effective Potential for Mercury
The effective central-force potential for a test mass m orbiting the Sun in FFGFT becomes:
U_FFGFT(r) = -GMm/r + L²/(2mr²) - (GM L²)/(m c² r³).
Terms:
• −GMm/r : Newtonian gravity,
• L²/(2mr²) : centrifugal barrier,
• −GM L²/(m c² r³) : FFGFT high-g correction.
This 1/r³ term is responsible for perihelion precession.
4. Orbit Equation Using Classical Mechanics Only
Define u(φ) = 1/r. The Binet equation for a central potential U(r) is:
d²u/dφ² + u = -(m / L²u²) (dU/dr).
Convert U(r) to U(u):
U(u) = -k u + (L²/2m)u² + β u³,
where k = GMm, β = −GM L²/(m c²).
Taking the derivative and substituting into Binet’s equation yields:
d²u/dφ² + (mk/L²) = (3mβ/L²) u².
The β-term represents the FFGFT correction. For β=0, this gives perfect ellipses.
5. Perturbative Solution and Precession
Using the unperturbed solution:
u₀(φ) = (mk/L²)(1 + e cosφ),
and treating β as a small parameter, the first-order perturbation yields a precession per orbit:
Δφ = 6π k² / (L² c² (1−e²)).
Substitute k = GMm and L² = m²GM a(1−e²):
Δφ = 6π GM / (a (1−e²) c²).
This equation can be used to calculate the perihelion precession for Mercury.

• Speed of light: c = 2.9979 × 10⁸ m/s
• → c² = 8.9876 × 10¹⁶ m² s⁻²
• Mercury semi-major axis: a = 5.7909 × 10¹⁰ m
• Mercury orbital eccentricity: e = 0.2056
• Mercury orbital period: T ≈ 0.240846 years
7. Compute the Denominator: a(1 − e²)c²
First compute 1 − e²:
1 − e² ≈ 1 − (0.2056)² = 0.9577
Multiply:
a(1 − e²) ≈ 5.7909 × 10¹⁰ × 0.9577 = 5.54 × 10¹⁰ m
Now multiply by c²:
a(1 − e²)c² ≈ 5.54 × 10¹⁰ × 8.99 × 10¹⁶
= 4.98 × 10²⁷ m³ s⁻²
8. Compute the Dimensionless Factor GM / [a(1 − e²)c²]
GM = 1.3271 × 10²⁰ m³ s⁻²
Divide:
GM / [a(1 − e²)c²] = 1.3271 × 10²⁰ / 4.9846 × 10²⁷
≈ 2.66 × 10⁻⁸
9. Multiply by 6π to Get Radians per Orbit
6π ≈ 18.8496
Thus:
Δφ (radians/orbit) = 18.8496 × 2.66 × 10⁻⁸
≈ 5.02 × 10⁻⁷ radians per orbit
10. Convert Radians per Orbit → Arcseconds per Orbit
1 radian = 206,264.806 arcseconds
Multiply:
Δφ_arcsec = 5.02 × 10⁻⁷ × 2.06265 × 10⁵
≈ 0.1035 arcseconds per orbit
11. Orbits per Century
Mercury orbital period:
T ≈ 0.240846 years
Thus number of orbits in 100 years:
N = 100 / 0.240846 ≈ 415.2 orbits per century
9. Total Perihelion Advance per Century
Multiply the per-orbit advance by the number of orbits:
Δφ_century = 0.1035 arcsec/orbit × 415.2 orbits/century
≈ 42.98 arcseconds per century
Thus:
Δφ_FFGFT ≈ 43 arcsec/century
which matches the observed anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury.

• Classical mechanics,
• FFGFT effective potential,

• No Einstein field equations.
6. Why FFGFT Predicts the Same Result as GR in this Regime
Because Mercury is deep in the high-acceleration regime:
g >> a₀,
FFGFT's nonlinear low-acceleration corrections vanish. Its weak-field expansion forces a 1/r³ correction
identical in functional form to GR’s 1PN term. Solar System tests constrain any deviation to <10⁻¹¹
fractionally, so the FFGFT correction coefficient must match GR’s to this accuracy.
7. Physical Interpretation
• FFGFT predicts Newtonian gravity with a small relativistic correction from θ-field curvature.
• This correction appears as an extra inward acceleration proportional to 1/r³.
• That correction shifts the orbital frequency slightly, causing the perihelion to advance.
• FFGFT predicts the same value as GR because both theories share the same high-g limit.
Conclusion
Using only FFGFT (and classical orbit theory), the perihelion shift is:
Δφ_FFGFT = 6π GM / (a (1−e²) c²).
This reproduces the observed 43 arcsec/century without invoking Einstein’s equations. Therefore: FFGFT
is consistent with Solar System precision tests while remaining a fundamentally different theory from GR
in the low-acceleration regime.
