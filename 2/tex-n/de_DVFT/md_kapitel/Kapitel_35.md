QUANTUM PHENOMENA EXPLAINED
FFGFT interprets quantum mechanics as the behavior of vacuum-phase and vacuum-amplitude fields. This
chapter provides a unified explanation for twelve major unsolved quantum phenomena, including collapse,
entanglement, zero point energy, decoherence and delayed-choice experiments. FFGFT clarifies these
phenomena by grounding them in the physical fields Φ = ρ e^{iθ}.
1. Wavefunction Collapse
In FFGFT, collapse is not a postulate. It occurs when vacuum-phase coherence (θ) is disrupted by
macroscopic interactions. Measurement destroys θ-coherence, forcing ψ to localize.
2. Wave–Particle Duality
Waves correspond to coherent vacuum-phase patterns, while particles correspond to localized vacuumamplitude excitations. Duality becomes a property of Φ, not a paradox.
3. Entanglement
Entanglement arises from shared vacuum-phase coherence between separated systems. Global coherence
of θ allows nonlocal correlations without signaling.
4. Zero-Point Energy

Dynamic vacuum field gives finite, physical zero-point energy ε_vac = ρ₀² (dθ/dt)², connecting vacuum
energy to cosmological acceleration.
5. Delayed Choice & Quantum Eraser
Interference depends on θ-coherence. Which-path detectors scramble θ; erasure restores it. FFGFT removes
retrocausality by explaining phase re-coherence.
6. Decoherence
Decoherence is vacuum-phase scrambling. Macroscopic systems distort θ-fields and eliminate
interference patterns physically, not abstractly.
7. Quantum Randomness
Randomness arises from unavoidable vacuum-phase fluctuations: Δθ · ΔE ≥ ħ/2 produces inherent phase
jitter in Φ.
8. Atomic Quantization
Energy quantization corresponds to θ-field circulation conditions: ∮ ∇θ · dl = 2πn. Atomic spectra reflect
dynamic vacuum field waves.
Conclusion
FFGFT unifies gravity and quantum mechanics by grounding quantum behavior in vacuum-phase
properties. Interference, collapse, entanglement, and decoherence all follow naturally from Φ = ρ e^{iθ}.
