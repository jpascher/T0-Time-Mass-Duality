GRAVITATIONAL CURVATURE EQUATIONS
1. Introduction
This chapter presents a complete formulation of gravitational curvature using the Dynamic Vacuum Field
Theory (FFGFT). Curvature emerges from the interplay between the metric g_{μν} and the vacuum phase
field θ through the FFGFT action. The result is a unified set of equations one for the vacuum field θ and
one for the spacetime curvature. GR appears as the high-acceleration limit of FFGFT.
2. FFGFT Fundamentals
The vacuum is modeled as a dynamic vacuum field described by the complex order parameter:
Φ(x) = ρ(x) e^{iθ(x)}.
The gravitational degrees of freedom include:
• Metric g_{μν}, determining curvature.
• Phase field θ, governing vacuum convergence.
The kinetic invariant is:
X ≡ -g^{μν} ∇_μθ ∇_νθ.
The Dynamic vacuum field Curvature Tensor (FFGFT) is defined as:
V_{μν} ≡ ∇_μ∇_νθ − (1/4) g_{μν} □θ,
with □θ = g^{αβ} ∇_α∇_βθ.
3. FFGFT Action (Pure Gravity + Vacuum + Matter)
The full FFGFT action is:
S = ∫ d⁴x √−g [ (1/(16πG)) R + 𝓛_θ(X, I₁, I₂) + 𝓛_m(g_{μν},ψ_m) ].
Here:
• R is the Ricci scalar (geometry),
• 𝓛_m is matter Lagrangian,
• 𝓛_θ encodes vacuum microphysics:
𝓛_θ = −Λ_v + (ρ₀/2)X − (η/(3a₀²)) X^{3/2} + α₁ I₁ + α₂ I₂,
with invariants:
I₁ = V_{μν} V^{μν},
I₂ = V_{μ}^{ α} V_{α}^{ β} V_{β}^{ μ}.
4. θ Field Equation (Dynamics)
Varying S with respect to θ gives the FFGFT vacuum equation:
∇_μ ( 𝓛_X ∇^μθ ) + α₁ 𝓔^{(1)}[θ,g] + α₂ 𝓔^{(2)}[θ,g] = 0,
where:
𝓛_X = ∂𝓛_θ/∂X = ρ₀/2 − (η/(2a₀²)) X^{1/2}.
This is a nonlinear wave equation for θ. It determines how the vacuum phase converges into matter and
controls weak-field gravity without needing GR.

5. Curvature Equation from Metric Variation
Varying S with respect to the metric g_{μν} yields:
G_{μν} = 8πG ( T^{(m)}_{μν} + T^{(θ)}_{μν} ),
where G_{μν} is the Einstein tensor arising from variation of √−g R.
The vacuum stress-energy T^{(θ)}_{μν} splits into:
1. k-essence (from X):
T^{(θ,kess)}_{μν} = 2 𝓛_X ∇_μθ ∇_νθ − g_{μν} 𝓛_θ(kess).
2. FFGFT curvature-like part:
T^{(θ,FFGFT)}_{μν} = 2α₁ ∂I₁/∂g^{μν} + 2α₂ ∂I₂/∂g^{μν} − g_{μν}(α₁ I₁ + α₂ I₂).
Thus, curvature is determined entirely by θ dynamics and matter, not by assuming Einstein’s equation.
6. Pure FFGFT Gravitational Equation
Define the total vacuum tensor:
T^{(θ)}_{μν} = T^{(θ,kess)}_{μν} + T^{(θ,FFGFT)}_{μν}.
Then the fundamental FFGFT gravitational curvature law is:
E_{μν}[θ,g] ≡ (1/(8πG)) G_{μν} − T^{(θ)}_{μν} = T^{(m)}_{μν}.
This replaces Einstein’s equations. GR is recovered when θ’s nonlinearities vanish.
7. GR as a Limiting Case of FFGFT
In high-acceleration environments (Solar System, neutron stars):
• X is large → 𝓛_X ≈ constant.
• FFGFT invariants I₁, I₂ are suppressed.
• T^{(θ)}_{μν} ≈ −Λ_eff g_{μν}.
Then FFGFT Gravitational Equation reduces to:
G_{μν} + Λ_eff g_{μν} ≈ 8πG T^{(m)}_{μν},
which is Einstein’s equation with a cosmological constant.
Thus, GR is not fundamental—it's the high-g limit of FFGFT.
8. Low-Acceleration Curvature: Pure FFGFT Regime
In galaxies (g ~ a₀ or below):
• Nonlinear term X^{3/2} dominates,
• FFGFT invariants contribute significantly,
• θ-field deviates strongly from GR predictions.
The curvature now follows pure FFGFT dynamics:
G_{μν} ≈ 8πG T^{(θ)}_{μν},
leading to flat rotation curves and MOND-like behavior without dark matter. Example of two galaxies
NGC-3198 and Andromeda rotational speed calculation using FFGFT has been shown in next chapter.
9. Summary of FFGFT-Only Curvature Framework
Using FFGFT, gravitational curvature is fully described by:
1. θ-field equation:
∇_μ( 𝓛_X ∇^μθ ) + FFGFT terms = 0.
2. Pure FFGFT curvature equation:
G_{μν} = 8πG ( T^{(m)}_{μν} + T^{(θ)}_{μν} ).
No Einstein field equations are introduced by hand—GR emerges only as a limiting case. This is a
complete gravitational theory in its own right, derived purely from dynamic vacuum field microphysics.
