PLANCK UNITS AND UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS
1. Introduction
This document explains how Fundamental Fractal-Geometric Field Theory(FFGFT) derives the Planck time, length, and
mass, as well as other 'universal constants', from the fundamental vacuum parameters:
• B – vacuum phase stiffness
• ρ₀ – inertial vacuum density
• K₀ – amplitude stiffness of vacuum
• λₘ – matter–vacuum coupling constant
• ħ – emerging from topological phase quantization
• θ-winding scale – phase gradient associated with unit charge

FFGFT shows that Planck units are *not fundamental constants* but emergent mechanical properties of
the vacuum field Φ = ρ e^{iθ}.
2. FFGFT Vacuum Parameters
The key numerical vacuum parameters are:
• Phase stiffness: B ≈ 8.7 × 10⁻⁵⁵
• Inertial vacuum density: ρ₀ ≈ 6 × 10⁻²⁷ kg/m³
• Amplitude stiffness: K₀ ≈ 5.4 × 10⁻¹⁰ J/m³
• Phase gradient for one charge: |∂θ/∂x|ₑ ≈ 1.63 × 10¹³ m⁻¹
• Speed of light (derived): c = √(K₀ / ρ₀)
• Newton’s G (derived): G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
• Fine-structure constant (derived): α = (B / ħ c)(∂θ/∂x)²
These constants collectively define the mechanical, gravitational, and quantum architecture of the vacuum.
3. FFGFT Substitutes into Planck Units
Textbook definitions of Planck units are:
• t_P = √(ħ G / c⁵)
• ℓ_P = √(ħ G / c³)
• m_P = √(ħ c / G)
But in FFGFT, none of ħ, c, or G are fundamental:
• c = √(K₀ / ρ₀)
• G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
• ħ arises from θ-winding quantization
Substituting these relations gives the Planck units as explicit composites of FFGFT vacuum parameters.
4. Planck Time from FFGFT
Starting with:
t_P = √(ħ G / c⁵)
Insert:
c = √(K₀/ρ₀)
G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
Compute:
t_P = √{ (ħ λₘ / (4π K₀)) / (K₀/ρ₀)^{5/2} }
Simplify:
t_P = √{ ħ λₘ ρ₀^{5/2} / (4π K₀^{7/2}) }.
This is the FFGFT expression for Planck time.
Interpretation:
Planck time is the minimum time scale at which vacuum amplitude curvature can sustain a stable
oscillation.
It is not a fundamental limit of nature, but a material property of the vacuum.
5. Planck Length from FFGFT
Textbook definition:
ℓ_P = √(ħ G / c³)
Substitute:
G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
c³ = (K₀/ρ₀)^{3/2}

Result:
ℓ_P = √{ ħ λₘ ρ₀^{3/2} / (4π K₀^{5/2}) }.
Interpretation:
Planck length is the smallest stable spatial scale of vacuum amplitude curvature — the 'acoustic
wavelength' of the vacuum medium.
6. Planck Mass from FFGFT
Textbook definition:
m_P = √(ħ c / G)
Insert:
c = √(K₀/ρ₀)
G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
Compute:
m_P = √{ (ħ √(K₀/ρ₀)) (4π K₀)/λₘ }
Simplify:
m_P = √{ 4π ħ K₀^{3/2} / (λₘ ρ₀^{1/2}) }.
Interpretation:
Planck mass is the amplitude deformation that matches one quantum of phase curvature.
7. Physical Meaning: Planck Units Are Emergent Vacuum Properties
In FFGFT:
• Planck time → minimum oscillation time of vacuum amplitude
• Planck length → minimum spatial curvature scale of vacuum amplitude
• Planck mass → amplitude curvature equivalent to one phase quantum
This new interpretation replaces the vague 'quantum gravity scale' with clear mechanical meaning.
Planck units describe **acoustic-like resonance properties** of the vacuum medium.
8. Other Constants Derived from FFGFT
FFGFT reduces many universal constants to derivatives of vacuum parameters:
1. Speed of light:
c = √(K₀/ρ₀)
2. Gravitational constant:
G = λₘ / (4π K₀)
3. Fine-structure constant:
α = (B / ħ c)(∂θ/∂x)²
4. Electron charge:
e² = 4π ε₀ ħ c α → e arises from B and phase topology
5. Dark-energy density:
ρ_Λ c² ≈ K₀
6. Deep-field acceleration scale (MOND-like):
a₀ ≈ c² / L_* (L_* = cosmic coherence length)
7. Neutrino mass scale:
m_ν ∝ B (phase oscillation over long coherence lengths)
8. Quantum coherence length of vacuum:
L_coh ≈ √(ħ / B)
Every one of these constants is derived — none are fundamental.

9. Consequences for Physics
Because all universal constants are derived from the vacuum parameters, FFGFT provides:
• A complete unification of gravity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism
• A physical explanation for Planck units
• A mechanism for dark energy
• The origin of α, e, c, G, ħ
• Predictive power across scales from the proton to cosmology
• A new foundation for quantum technologies (phase-based computing)
FFGFT reinterprets the universe as a material medium with definable mechanical constants B, K₀, ρ₀, from
which all physical scales emerge.
Conclusion
FFGFT transforms the Planck constants from unexplained numerology into physically meaningful
emergent properties of the vacuum’s amplitude–phase structure. This resolves long-standing conceptual
gaps between quantum mechanics, relativity, and cosmology, and positions FFGFT as a unified framework
where the numerical structure of the universe is derived from the underlying nature of the vacuum.
