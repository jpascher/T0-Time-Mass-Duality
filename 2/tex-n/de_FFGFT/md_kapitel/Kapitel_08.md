GALAXY ROTATION CURVES AND MISSING MASS PROBLEM
Modern astrophysics and cosmology face numerous unresolved problems that General Relativity (GR)
and the ΛCDM model cannot fully explain without invoking dark matter particles, fine-tuned inflation
fields, unexplained singularities, or an arbitrary cosmological constant. FFGFT provides a physically
grounded alternative by treating spacetime as a dynamic vacuum field.
One of the prime achievement of FFGFT is that galaxy rotation anomalies follow directly from FFGFT deep
field physics, eliminating the need for dark matter halos. Two examples presented to calculate the
rotational speed of NGC 3198 Galaxy and Andromeda Galaxy (M31) using only baryonic mass without
taking any dark matter mass into account.
FFGFT defines the vacuum field as Φ = ρ e^{iθ}. In the weak-field, low-acceleration outer regions of
galaxies where observed rotation curves deviate from Newtonian predictions, FFGFT predicts a nonlinear

vacuum response based on deep field equations derived from vacuum Lagrangian gives the baryonic
Tully–Fisher relation:
v_c⁴ = G M_b a₀
Where, v_c is circular speed, M_b is Baryonic mass and G is Newton’s Gravitational Constant
These equations are derived from the basic FFGFT equation Φ = ρ e^{iθ} and the vacuum Lagrangian.
Complete derivation of this equation has been given below.
1. FFGFT Vacuum Lagrangian and Φ = ρ e^{iθ}
Start with a minimal FFGFT vacuum Lagrangian:
𝓛 = ½ A |∂ₜΦ|² − ½ B(ρ) |∇Φ|² − U(ρ) − ρ_b φ(ρ,θ),
where:
• A is vacuum temporal inertia,
• B(ρ) is vacuum spatial stiffness,
• U(ρ) is the vacuum amplitude potential,
• ρ_b is baryonic matter density,
• φ is the gravitational potential encoded in θ.
Substitute Φ = ρ e^{iθ}:
• |∂ₜΦ|² = (∂ₜρ)² + ρ²(∂ₜθ)²
• |∇Φ|² = |∇ρ|² + ρ²|∇θ|²
Thus:
𝓛 = ½A[(∂ₜρ)² + ρ²(∂ₜθ)²] − ½B(ρ)[|∇ρ|² + ρ²|∇θ|²] − U(ρ) − ρ_b φ.
2. Static Nonrelativistic Limit
For galaxy rotation curves, time derivatives are negligible:
• ∂ₜρ ≈ 0,
• ∂ₜθ ≈ constant (background vacuum oscillation).
FFGFT identifies gravitational potential φ through phase evolution:
∂ₜθ = ω₀(1 + φ/c²) ⇒ ∇θ = (ω₀/c²) ∇φ.
Thus, the vacuum energy density becomes:
ℰ_vac ≈ ½ K(ρ) |∇φ|² + U(ρ),
where K(ρ) = B(ρ) ρ² (ω₀² / c⁴).
This shows that gravitational behavior arises from spatial variations of φ, mediated by vacuum amplitude
ρ.
3. Integrating Out the Vacuum Amplitude ρ
At equilibrium (static galaxies), ρ adjusts to minimize local vacuum energy:
∂/∂ρ [½K(ρ)|∇φ|² + U(ρ)] = 0.
This yields an algebraic relation:
½ K'(ρ)|∇φ|² + U'(ρ) = 0.
In high-acceleration regimes, ρ ≈ ρ₀ (the vacuum ground amplitude) and Newtonian gravity emerges.
In low-acceleration regimes, the vacuum becomes nearly coherent, U'(ρ) → 0, allowing ρ to respond
strongly to |∇φ|.
Scale invariance of FFGFT in this regime requires the vacuum energy to scale as:
ℰ ∝ |∇φ|³.
This corresponds to a vacuum functional:
F(y) ∝ y^{3/2}, y = |∇φ|² / a₀².

4. Deep-Field Lagrangian
In the deep-field regime (g ≪ a₀), the vacuum Lagrangian becomes:
𝓛_eff = − (a₀²/8πG) F(|∇φ|²/a₀²) − ρ_b φ,
with:
F(y) = (2/3) y^{3/2}.
Varying this with respect to φ yields the field equation:
∇·[(|∇φ|/a₀) ∇φ] = 4πG ρ_b.
Define gravitational acceleration g = |∇φ|; then:
∇·[(g/a₀) ĝ g] = 4πG ρ_b.
5. Spherical Galaxy: Deriving g² = a₀ g_N
For a spherical mass distribution:
g(r) = |∇φ| = dφ/dr.
The FFGFT deep-field equation becomes:
(1/r²) d/dr (r² g² / a₀) = 4πG ρ_b(r).
Integrate from 0 to r:
r² g² / a₀ = G M_b(r).
Solve for g:
g²(r) = a₀ (G M_b(r)/r²) = a₀ g_N(r).
This is exactly the FFGFT deep-field force law:
g² = a₀ g_N.
6. Rotation Curves and Tully–Fisher Relation
The circular velocity satisfies:
g(r) = v_c²(r)/r.
Insert into g² = a₀ g_N:
(v_c²/r)² = a₀ (G M_b / r²).
Simplify:
v_c⁴(r) = G M_b(r) a₀.
In the flat part of the rotation curve, M_b(r) → constant = M_b, giving the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation
:
v_c⁴ = G M_b a₀,
7. Physical Meaning in FFGFT
In FFGFT:
• amplitude ρ determines inertia and curvature,
• phase θ determines wave propagation and time,
• gravity arises from phase-time distortions governed by nonlinear vacuum response.
In low-acceleration galactic outskirts, the vacuum approaches coherent phase, causing gravitational
behavior to shift from Newtonian (linear) to scale-invariant nonlinear regime.
This reproduces:
• flat rotation curves,
• g² = a₀ g_N,
• the baryonic Tully–Fisher law,
• all without dark matter.

Starting from the fundamental FFGFT field Φ = ρ e^{iθ}, we derived:
• an effective vacuum energy ∝ |∇φ|³,
• the deep-field equation ∇·[(g/a₀) g] = 4πGρ_b,
• the spherical solution g² = a₀ g_N,
• and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation v_c⁴ = G M_b a₀.
Thus, galaxy rotation anomalies follow directly from FFGFT vacuum physics, eliminating the need for
dark matter halos.
Let’s use this equation to calculate the galaxy rotational speed only using visible mass without taking dark
matter into account and compare it with actual observational rotation speed of these two galaxies.
9. NGC 3198 Galaxy
Rotation curve: nearly flat at v ≈ 150 km/s beyond r ≳ 20 kpc.
Stellar mass from BTFR / photometric fits: total baryonic mass M_b ≈ 2.46 × 10¹⁰ M_⊙.
Rotation Speed using baryonic Tully–Fisher relation v_c⁴ = G M_b a₀ with a₀ = 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s²:
v_c ≈ 141 km/s.
Interpretation: FFGFT prediction close to the observed 150 km/s without dark matter.
10. Andromeda Galaxy
Rotation curve: nearly flat at v ≈ 220 – 226 km/s between 20 -35 kpc
Total baryonic mass: ≈ 1.6×10¹¹ M_⊙ (Stars + Gas)
Rotation Speed using baryonic Tully–Fisher relation v_c⁴ = G M_b a₀ with a₀ = 1.2×10⁻¹⁰ m/s²
v_c ≈ 220 km/s.
Interpretation: FFGFT prediction close to the observed 220 - 226 km/s without dark matter.
Conclusion
Both NGC 3198 and Andromeda Galaxies behaves exactly as predicted by FFGFT deep field equation
gives a flat rotation curve set directly by baryonic mass, with no requirement for dark matter.
FFGFT provides gravitational equations which eliminates requirement of dark matter in cosmological
calculations.
