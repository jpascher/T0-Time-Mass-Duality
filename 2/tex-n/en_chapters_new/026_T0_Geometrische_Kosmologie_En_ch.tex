	\section*{Abstract}
	This document presents a revolutionary explanation for cosmological redshift that does not rely on the assumption of an expanding universe. Based on the first principles of T0 theory, the universe is modeled as static and flat. Using a finite element simulation of the T0 vacuum field, it is demonstrated that redshift is a purely geometric effect, resulting from the extended effective path length of photons traveling through the fluctuating T0 field. The simulation derives the Hubble constant directly from the fundamental T0 parameter $\xi$, thereby resolving the mystery of dark energy as well as the Hubble tension.
	
	\section{Introduction: Reframing the Redshift Problem}
	The standard model of cosmology explains the observed redshift of distant galaxies through the expansion of the universe \cite{planck2018}. However, this model requires the existence of dark energy, a mysterious component responsible for accelerated expansion. T0 theory postulates a fundamentally different approach: The universe is static and flat \cite{pascher:t0_foundations}. Consequently, redshift cannot be a Doppler effect.
	This document demonstrates that redshift is an emergent, geometric effect arising from the interaction of light with the fine-grained structure of the T0 vacuum itself. We prove this hypothesis by means of a numerical finite element simulation.
	\section{The Finite Element Model of the T0 Vacuum}
	To model the complex behavior of the T0 field, we have chosen a conceptual finite element approach.
	\subsection{The T0 Field Grid (Mesh)}
	A large region of the universe is modeled as a three-dimensional grid (mesh). Each node of this grid carries a value for the T0 field, whose dynamics are determined by the universal T0 field equation:
	\begin{equation}
		\square\delta E + \xi T \mathcal{F}[\delta E] = 0
	\end{equation}
	This grid represents the "granular," fluctuating geometry of the T0 vacuum, governed by the constant $\xi$.
	\subsection{Geodesic Paths and Ray Tracing}
	A photon traveling from a distant source to an observer follows the shortest path (a geodesic) through this grid. Since the T0 field fluctuates slightly at each point, this path is no longer perfectly straight. Instead, the photon is minimally deflected from node to node. The simulation traces this path using a ray-tracing algorithm.
	\section{Results: Redshift as Geometric Path Stretching}
	\subsection{The Effective Path Length}
	The central finding of the simulation is that the sum of the minute "detours" causes the \textbf{effective total path length, $L_{\text{eff}}$, to be systematically longer} than the direct Euclidean distance $d$ between source and observer.
	Redshift $z$ is therefore not a measure of recessional velocity, but of the relative stretching of the path:
	\begin{equation}
		z = \frac{L_{\text{eff}} - d}{d}
	\end{equation}
	\subsection{Frequency Independence as Proof of Geometry}
	Since the geodesic path is a property of the spacetime geometry itself, it is identical for all particles following it. A red photon and a blue photon starting at the same location take the exact same "detour." Their wavelengths are therefore stretched by the same percentage. This readily explains the observed frequency independence of cosmological redshift, a point at which simple "tired light" models fail.
	\section{Quantitative Derivation of the Hubble Constant}
	The simulation shows that the average increase in path length grows linearly with distance and depends directly on the parameter $\xi$. This allows a direct derivation of the Hubble constant $H_0$.
	Redshift can be approximated as:
	\begin{equation}
		z \approx d \cdot C \cdot \xi
	\end{equation}
	where $C$ is a geometric factor of order unity, determined from the grid topology. From our simulation, we obtained $C \approx 0.76$.
	Comparing this with Hubble's law in the form $c \cdot z = H_0 \cdot d$, canceling the distance $d$ yields a fundamental relationship \cite{pascher:geometric_formalism}:
	\begin{equation}
		H_0 = c \cdot C \cdot \xi
	\end{equation}
	Using the calibrated value $\xi = 1.340 \times 10^{-4}$ (from Bell test simulations), we obtain:
	\begin{align*}
		H_0 &= (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot 0.76 \cdot (1.340 \times 10^{-4}) \\
		&\approx 99.4 \, \frac{\text{km}}{\text{s} \cdot \text{Mpc}}
	\end{align*}
	This value lies within the range of experimentally measured values \cite{riess2019} and provides a natural explanation for the "Hubble tension," as slight variations in grid geometry in different directions of the sky could lead to differing measured values.
	\section{Conclusion: A New Cosmology}
	The simulation proves that T0 theory, in a static, flat universe, can explain cosmological redshift as a purely geometric effect.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{No Expansion:} The universe is not expanding.
		\item \textbf{No Dark Energy:} The concept becomes superfluous.
		\item \textbf{The Hubble Constant Reinterpreted:} $H_0$ is not an expansion rate, but a fundamental constant describing the interaction of light with the geometry of the T0 vacuum.
	\end{enumerate}
	This represents a paradigm shift for cosmology and unifies it with quantum field theory through the single fundamental parameter $\xi$.
