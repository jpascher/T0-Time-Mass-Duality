\section*{Abstract}
		The implementation of photonic components on wafers (e.g., TFLN or Si-Photonics) enables scalable, low-latency systems for 6G networks. **The global strategy for 2025 focuses on the industrialization of Thin-Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) through specialized foundries \cite{tfln_foundry} and the development of scalable photonic quantum computers (LNOI/PhoQuant) \cite{phoquant}.** This introduction is based on current literature (2024–2025) and highlights fabrication processes (ion-slicing, wafer bonding), preferred techniques (MZI integration), and relevance for signal processing. Practical focus: Table of methods, outlook on hybrid PICs. Sources: Nature, ScienceDirect, arXiv. **A novel optoelectronic chip integrating terahertz and optical signals is a key enabler for millimeter-precise distance measurement and high-performance 6G mobile communications \cite{thz_epfl}.**

	
	
	\section{Fundamentals: Why Wafer Integration in Communications Engineering?}
	
	The fabrication of photonic components on wafers (e.g., Thin-Film Lithium Niobate, TFLN) is revolutionizing communications engineering: Scalable production of integrated circuits (PICs) for RF signal processing, 6G MIMO, and AI-assisted routing. **The transition to volume manufacturing is accelerated by specialized TFLN foundries, such as the QCi Foundry, which is accepting its first commercial pilot orders in 2025 \cite{tfln_foundry}. Globally, 2025 (International Year of Quantum Science) highlights the strategic importance of photonics for competitiveness \cite{quantenjahr25}.** Wafer-based processes (e.g., ion-slicing + bonding) enable monolithic integration of $>\SI{1000}{components}/\text{wafer}$, with losses $<\SI{1}{dB}$ and bandwidths $>\SI{100}{GHz}$.
	\begin{important}
		Important note: The technology is hybrid-analog: Optical waveguides for continuous processing, combined with electronic control. This reduces latency (picosecond range) and energy (picojoule/bit), essential for real-time 6G applications.
	\end{important}
	
	Current trends (2025): Transition to $\SI{300}{mm}$ wafers for industrial scaling, focusing on flexible, cost-effective processes \cite{flexible_wafer}.
	\section{Implementation: Key Processes for Component Integration}
	
	Implementation is carried out in multi-stage processes, closely aligned with semiconductor fabrication (e.g., CMOS-compatible). Core steps:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Ion-slicing and Wafer Bonding}: For thin films (e.g., LiTaO$_3$ on Si); enables high density without substrate losses \cite{lithium_tantalate}.
		\item \textbf{Etching and Lithography}: Mask-CMP for waveguide microstructures; precise structures ($<\SI{100}{nm}$) for MZI arrays \cite{on_chip_lithium}.
		\item \textbf{Monolithic Integration}: Co-packaging of electronics/photonics; reduces latency in hybrid systems \cite{integration_microelectronic}.
		\item \textbf{Flexible Wafer Scaling}: Mechanically flexible $\SI{300}{mm}$ platforms for cost-effective production \cite{flexible_wafer}.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{formula}
		Example: Wafer Bonding for LNOI (Lithium Niobate on Insulator): Thickness $t = \SI{525}{\micro\meter}$, implantation dose $D = 5 \times 10^{16}\,$cm$^{-2}$, resulting layer thickness $h \approx \SI{400}{nm}$.
	\end{formula}
	
	\section{Preferred Components and Operations on Wafers}
	
	Photonic wafers are suitable for linear, frequency-dependent components; analog integration prioritizes interference-based operations for 6G signals. **Besides TFLN, the silicon nitride (SiN) platform is also being promoted to offer PICs for life sciences and sensing \cite{hhi_6g}.**
