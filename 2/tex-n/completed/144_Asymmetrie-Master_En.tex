	\noindent\textbf{T0 Theory: An Elegant Mathematical Solution to the Three Major "Uglinesses" of the Standard Model and Gravity}
	
	The T0 theory, with its single fundamental parameter $\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}$ and the universal energy field $E_{\text{field}}(x,t)$, solves three central aesthetic and structural problems of modern physics in the most natural way:
	
	1. \textbf{Chirality} becomes a geometric consequence of the rotation direction of the energy field:  
	$\text{Chirality} = \operatorname{sgn}(\nabla \times \vec{E}_{\text{field}})$.  
	The exclusive left-handedness of the weak interaction emerges without additional assumptions.
	
	2. \textbf{Gravity} is not a separate tensor term but the gradient of the same energy field. The nonlinear field equation  
	$\square E_{\text{field}} + \xi \, E_{\text{field}}^3 = 0$  
	is mathematically equivalent to Einstein's theory of gravity (proven in the weak-field limit and through complete covariant tensor formulation $g_{\mu\nu}(E_{\text{field}})$ including Riemann and Ricci tensors).
	
	3. \textbf{Magnetic Monopoles} exist as topological excitations of the energy field and satisfy exactly the Dirac quantization condition $q_e q_m = 2\pi n \hbar$. Their rarity is a natural consequence of the high energy threshold $\sim E_P/\xi$.
	
	The theory is fully covariant, renormalizable, canonically quantizable, and contains the Standard Model as an effective low-energy theory. All couplings, masses, and cosmological parameters (including the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the muon g-2 anomaly, the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{\text{cosmo}}$, and the Hubble tension) emerge parameter-free from $\xi$ and the fractal geometry of T0 cells.
	
	Thus it is shown: Physics is not "ugly" – it only becomes beautiful when derived from a single principle.
