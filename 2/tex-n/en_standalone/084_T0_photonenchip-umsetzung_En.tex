\title{Introduction to the Implementation of Photonic Components on Wafers}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
		The implementation of photonic components on wafers (e.g., TFLN or Si photonics) enables scalable, low-latency systems for 6G networks. **The global strategy focuses in 2025 on the industrialization of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) through specialized foundries \cite{tfln_foundry} and the development of scalable photonic quantum computers (LNOI/PhoQuant) \cite{phoquant}.** This introduction is based on current literature (2024–2025) and highlights fabrication processes (ion slicing, wafer bonding), preferred techniques (MZI integration), and relevance for signal processing. Practical: Table of methods, outlook on hybrid PICs. Sources: Nature, ScienceDirect, arXiv. **A new optoelectronic chip that integrates terahertz and optical signals is key to millimeter-precise distance measurement and high-performance 6G mobile communications \cite{thz_epfl}.**

	\section{Basics: Why Wafer Integration in Communication Engineering?}
	
	The fabrication of photonic components on wafers (e.g., thin-film lithium niobate, TFLN) revolutionizes communication engineering: Scalable production of integrated circuits (PICs) for RF signal processing, 6G MIMO, and AI-assisted routing. **The transition to high-volume manufacturing is accelerated by specialized TFLN foundries, such as the QCi Foundry, which will accept the first commercial pilot orders in 2025 \cite{tfln_foundry}. Globally, 2025 (International Year of Quantum Science and Technology) highlights the strategic importance of photonics for competitiveness \cite{quantenjahr25}.** Wafer-based processes (e.g., ion slicing + bonding) enable monolithic integration of $>\SI{1000}{components}/\text{wafer}$, with losses $<\SI{1}{dB}$ and bandwidths $>\SI{100}{GHz}$.
	\begin{important}
		Important Note: The technology is hybrid-analog: Optical waveguides for continuous processing, combined with electronic control. This reduces latency ($\SI{}{\pico\second}$ range) and energy ($\SI{}{\pico\joule}/\text{bit}$), essential for real-time 6G applications.
	\end{important}
	
	Current trends (2025): Transition to $\SI{300}{mm}$ wafers for industrial scaling, focused on flexible, cost-effective processes \cite{flexible_wafer}.
	\section{Realization: Key Processes for Component Integration}
	
	The implementation occurs in multi-stage processes, strongly aligned with semiconductor fabrication (e.g., CMOS-compatible). Core steps:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Ion Slicing and Wafer Bonding}: For thin films (e.g., LiTaO$_3$ on Si); enables high density without substrate losses \cite{lithium_tantalate}.
		\item \textbf{Etching and Lithography}: Mask-CMP for waveguide microstructures; precise structures ($<\SI{100}{nm}$) for MZI arrays \cite{on_chip_lithium}.
		\item \textbf{Monolithic Integration}: Co-packaging of electronics/photonics; reduces latency in hybrid systems \cite{integration_microelectronic}.
		\item \textbf{Flexible Wafer Scaling}: Mechanically flexible $\SI{300}{mm}$ platforms for cost-effective production \cite{flexible_wafer}.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{formula}
		Example: Wafer bonding for LNOI (Lithium Niobate on Insulator): Thickness $t = \SI{525}{\micro\meter}$, implantation dose $D = 5 \times 10^{16}\,$cm$^{-2}$, resulting layer thickness $h \approx \SI{400}{nm}$.
	\end{formula}
	
	\section{Preferred Components and Operations on Wafers}
	
	Photonic wafers are suited for linear, frequency-dependent components; analog integration prioritizes interference-based operations for 6G signals. **In addition to TFLN, the silicon nitride (SiN) platform is being promoted to offer PICs for biosciences and sensing \cite{hhi_6g}.**
