		This document summarizes the experiment on the time-resolved formation of quantum entanglement (Jiang et al., 2024) and uses it as direct experimental evidence for the fundamental time dynamics postulated in the T$_0$-Time-Mass-Duality Theory. All theoretical interpretations are based exclusively on the content of the Master Narrative (FFGFT\_Narrative\_Master\_En.pdf) and related documents in the repository:

	\end{abstract}
	
	\section{The Experiment}
	The work by Jiang et al.\ (2024) demonstrates for the first time that quantum entanglement does \textbf{not} form instantaneously, but develops over a measurable local time window.
	
	\subsection{Experimental Details}
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		\item \textbf{System}: Helium atom exposed to an intense high-frequency EUV laser pulse (photoionization).
		\item \textbf{Process}: One electron absorbs energy and escapes (ionizes), while the second electron is excited to a higher energy state.
		\item \textbf{Superposition}: The escaping electron exists in a superposition of different departure times (no sharp instant).
		\item \textbf{Correlation}: The final energy of the bound electron is directly correlated with the departure time of the escaping electron:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Higher energy in the bound electron $\to$ escaping electron departed earlier
			\item Lower energy $\to$ escaping electron departed later
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Time Window}: Full time-dependent Schrödinger equation simulations and a proposed double-pulse measurement (generation pulse + probe pulse with coincidence detection) determine the formation window to be $\sim$\textbf{232 attoseconds} ($\approx 2.32 \times 10^{-16}$\,s).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Video Source}
	The experiment is summarized in a popular-science video:

	\section{Connection to the T$_0$-Time-Mass-Duality Theory}
	The results provide strong experimental support for the central claim of the theory:
	
	\begin{quote}
		„In the T$_0$-Time-Mass-Duality Theory, time is ontologically equivalent to mass and therefore not merely a coordinate, but an active physical quantity with real dynamics on all scales. Quantum correlations (entanglement) therefore do not arise instantaneously, but develop as a temporal, emergent process within a local interaction window. The attosecond-resolved measurement of $\sim 232$\,as confirms exactly this finite, dynamical build-up without non-local 'spooky action at a distance' and without violating causality.“
	\end{quote}
	
	This finding underscores that all quantum phenomena carry intrinsic time dynamics — a direct consequence of the fundamental duality between time and mass.
