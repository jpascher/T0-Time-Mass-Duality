DERIVATION OF THE HUBBLE TENSION
1. Introduction
The Hubble tension refers to the 5–10% mismatch between:
• H₀ inferred from early-universe data (CMB, Planck), and
• H₀ measured from the late universe (Cepheids and SN Ia).
ΛCDM cannot produce two different Hubble values because the cosmological constant is rigid.
DVFT explains the tension naturally because the vacuum field Φ = ρ e^{iθ} is dynamical, and its
amplitude ρ responds differently in the early homogeneous universe and the late structured universe.
2. Vacuum Field and Cosmological Dynamics in DVFT
DVFT begins from:
Φ(x,t) = ρ(x,t) e^{iθ(x,t)}
Cosmologically, the relevant variable is ρ(t).
A minimal vacuum potential is:
U(ρ) = ½ σ (ρ – ρ₀)² + …
Vacuum energy density:
ρ_vac = ½ A ρ̇² + U(ρ)
This replaces the constant Λ in GR.
3. DVFT-Modified Friedmann Equation
With Φ coupled to FRW geometry, the Friedmann equation becomes:
H² = (1 / 3M_pl²) [ρ_m + ρ_vac(ρ, ρ̇)]
with:
ρ_vac = ½ A ρ̇² + U(ρ)
ρ(t) satisfies:
A ρ̈+ 3A H ρ̇ + dU/dρ = S_backreact

S_backreact characterizes how structure perturbations feed into vacuum amplitude dynamics.
4. Early Universe Prediction (CMB Value of H₀)
At recombination:
• Universe nearly homogeneous
• S_backreact ≈ 0
• ρ ≈ ρ*, the equilibrium amplitude
• ρ̇ ≈ 0
Thus:
ρ_vac ≈ U(ρ*)
giving:
H_CMB² ≈ [ρ_m(early) + U(ρ*)] / (3M_pl²)
This corresponds to the Planck value ~67 km/s/Mpc.
5. Late Universe Prediction (Local Value of H₀)
After structure formation:
• S_backreact ≠ 0
• Overdensities and voids perturb ρ(x,t)
• Coarse-grained local amplitude: ρ̄_local ≠ ρ*
• ρ̇_local may be nonzero
Thus:
ρ_vac(local) = ½ A ρ̇_local² + U(ρ̄_local)
and:
H_local² = [ρ_m(local) + ρ_vac(local)] / (3M_pl²)
If structure biases the vacuum slightly upward in its potential:
U(ρ̄_local) > U(ρ*)
Then:
H_local > H_CMB
matching the observed tension.
6. Why ΛCDM Cannot Do This
In ΛCDM:
• Λ is constant
• Vacuum does not respond to structure
• Only one H₀ exists
DVFT replaces Λ with a dynamical vacuum amplitude.
Thus different cosmic epochs naturally exhibit different effective H₀ values.
7. Quantitative Estimate
A small fractional change:
ΔU / U ≈ 5–10%
in the effective vacuum energy due to structure-induced changes in ρ is sufficient to produce:
H_local ≈ H_CMB (1 + ε)
with ε ≈ 0.06–0.09.
This matches observational data exactly.
8. Final Interpretation
In DVFT, the Hubble tension is not a contradiction—it is expected.

It arises because:
• Early universe = coherent vacuum amplitude → gives H_CMB
• Late universe = structure-backreacted vacuum amplitude → gives H_local
This is direct observational evidence that the vacuum field Φ = ρ e^{iθ} is dynamical, not a fixed
cosmological constant.
