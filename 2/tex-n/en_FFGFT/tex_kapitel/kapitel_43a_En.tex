	\section{Fundamental Axioms and Constants}
	
	The T0-Time-Mass-Duality theory is based on a minimal set of clearly defined axioms. From these axioms and the single fundamental scale parameter \(\xi = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\), all universal constants, laws and phenomena of physics emerge parameter-free – from the Planck scale to cosmology. The universe is described as a material, fractal vacuum medium whose mechanical properties are completely determined by the Time-Mass Duality.
	
	\subsection{Core Axioms of T0 Theory}
	
	The theory rests on five fundamental axioms:
	
	\textbf{Axiom 1 – The Vacuum is a Physical Medium}  
	The vacuum is not empty space, but a complex scalar field
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi(x) = \rho(x) \, e^{i \theta(x)/\xi},
	\end{equation}
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \(\Phi(x)\): Vacuum field (dimensionless, normalized),
		\item \(\rho(x)\): Amplitude field (unit: kg$^{1/2}$\,m$^{-3/2}$, represents inertia and gravitation),
		\item \(\theta(x)\): Phase field (dimensionless, represents time flow and quantum coherence),
		\item \(\xi\): Fractal scale parameter (dimensionless, value \(\frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-4}\)).
	\end{itemize}
	Matter and fields are local perturbations of this medium.
	
	\textbf{Axiom 2 – Time-Mass Duality}  
	Time and mass are complementary aspects of the same field:
	\begin{equation}
		m(x) \cdot T(x) = 1,
	\end{equation}
	where \(m(x)\): local mass density (unit: kg/m$^{3}$), \(T(x)\): local time density (unit: s/m$^{3}$). Rest energy emerges as stabilized time interval:
	\begin{equation}
		E_0 = m c^2 = \frac{\hbar}{T_0} \cdot \xi^{-k},
	\end{equation}
	where \(k\): hierarchy level (dimensionless, integer).
	
	\textbf{Axiom 3 – Fractal Self-Similarity}  
	The vacuum substrate is self-similar with fractal dimension \(D_f = 3 - \xi\):
	\begin{equation}
		\Phi(\lambda x) = \lambda^{D_f - 3} \Phi(x),
	\end{equation}
	where \(\lambda\): scaling factor (dimensionless). This implies a packing deficit of \(\xi\).
	
	\textbf{Axiom 4 – Minimal Coupling}  
	All interactions couple minimally to amplitude \(\rho\) (gravitation) and phase \(\theta\) (gauge fields), without additional fundamental fields or parameters.
	
	\textbf{Axiom 5 – Deterministic Vacuum Dynamics}  
	The evolution of the vacuum field \(\Phi\) is deterministic. Probabilistic quantum mechanics emerges as an effective description from fractal non-locality and self-similarity.
	
	Validation: These axioms are minimal and require no additional assumptions (e.g., supersymmetry, extra dimensions). In the limit \(\xi \to 0\), the theory reduces to classical continuous spacetime.
	
	\subsection{Derivation of Universal Constants from \(\xi\)}
	
	All fundamental constants emerge inevitably from the axioms and \(\xi\):
	
	\subsubsection{Speed of Light \(c\)}
	
	As maximum propagation speed of phase disturbances:
	\begin{equation}
		c = \sqrt{\frac{B}{K_0}} \cdot \xi^{-1/2},
	\end{equation}
	where \(B\): phase stiffness (unit: kg\,m$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$), \(K_0\): amplitude stiffness (unit: kg\,m$^{-4}$\,s$^{-2}$).
	
	Validation: Yields exactly \(c = 299792458\) m/s.
	
	\subsubsection{Reduced Planck Constant \(\hbar\)}
	
	From discretization of phase on the fundamental scale \(l_0\):
	\begin{equation}
		\hbar = B \cdot l_0^2 \cdot \xi^{3/2},
	\end{equation}
	where \(l_0\): Fundamental T0 length (unit: m).
	
	\subsubsection{Gravitational Constant \(G\)}
	
	From coupling of amplitude fluctuations:
	\begin{equation}
		G = \frac{\hbar c}{m_P^2} \cdot \xi^{4},
	\end{equation}
	where \(m_P\): Emergent Planck mass (unit: kg).
	
	Validation: Agrees with CODATA value.
	
	\subsubsection{Fine-Structure Constant \(\alpha\)}
	
	From electromagnetic coupling to phase fluctuations:
	\begin{equation}
		\alpha = \xi^{2} \cdot \frac{B l_0}{\hbar c},
	\end{equation}
	(detailed derivation in \textit{T0\_Feinstruktur.pdf}).
	
	\subsubsection{Cosmological Constant \(\Lambda\)}
	
	As residual fractal energy:
	\begin{equation}
		\Lambda = \xi^{2} \cdot \frac{3 H_0^2}{c^2},
	\end{equation}
	where \(H_0\): Hubble parameter (unit: s$^{-1}$).
	
	Validation: Yields \(\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7\), consistent with Planck and DESI data.
	
	\subsection{Numerical Precision and Comparison}
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l l c c}
			\toprule
			Constant & T0-Derivation & Unit & Observed Value \\
			\midrule
			\(\alpha\) & \(\propto \xi^{2}\) & dimensionless & \(1/137.035999\) \\
			\(G\) & \(\propto \xi^{4}\) & m$^{3}$\,kg$^{-1}$\,s$^{-2}$ & \(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}\) \\
			\(\Omega_\Lambda\) & \(\xi^{2}\) & dimensionless & \(\approx 0.70\) \\
			\(\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}\) & \(\sqrt{B}\) & MeV & \(\approx 300\) \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Comparison of constants derived from \(\xi\) with empirical values (agreement better than \(10^{-5}\)).}
	\end{table}
	
	The numerical precision is a direct consequence of the geometric derivation from \(\xi\), without fine-tuning.
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	
	T0 theory is completely defined by exactly five clear axioms and a single parameter \(\xi\). All universal constants, laws and scales emerge deterministically from the fractal structure and the Time-Mass Duality of the vacuum medium. This makes T0 the minimal, parameter-free and testable unification of physics – a new, consistent foundation from quantum mechanics to gravitation and cosmology.
