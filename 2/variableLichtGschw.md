# Variable Speed of Light in the T0 Model: A Critical Analysis
*by Johann Pascher*

## Introduction

In this document, I examine the mathematical and conceptual challenges of integrating variable speed of light (VSL) into my T0 model of time-mass duality. The conventional explanation of cosmological redshift relies on an expanding universe paradigm, but alternative approaches that question this fundamental assumption deserve serious consideration. While initial analysis suggests the T0 model might incorporate variable speed of light theory, deeper examination reveals significant incompatibilities with the fundamental architecture of the T0 framework.

## Three Compatible Interpretations

### 1. Original T0 Interpretation: Variable Mass, Constant c

In my original formulation, the intrinsic time field T(x) serves as the foundational entity mediating between quantum mechanics and relativity theory:

$$T(x) = \frac{\hbar}{\max(mc^2, \omega)}$$

With natural units (ħ = c = G = 1), this simplifies to T(x) = 1/m for massive particles. The gravitational potential emerges directly from T(x) gradients:

$$\Phi(x) = -\ln\left(\frac{T(x)}{T_0}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{m}{m_0}\right)$$

This produces the gravitational force:

$$\vec{F} = -\nabla\Phi = -\frac{\nabla m}{m}$$

Cosmological redshift in this framework arises from the time-dependent evolution of mass scales as T(x) evolves cosmologically:

$$m(t) = m_0 \cdot f(t)$$

Where f(t) relates to the cosmological correlation length L_T. This yields my distinctive redshift formula:

$$z(\lambda) = z_0\left(1 + \ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda_0}\right)\right)$$

This wavelength-dependent redshift prediction differentiates the T0 model from standard ΛCDM cosmology and provides a testable signature.

### 2. Variable Speed of Light Interpretation: Constant Mass, Variable c

If we instead focus on a variable speed of light while keeping mass constant:

$$c(t) = c_0 \cdot g(t)$$

Where g(t) is a cosmologically decreasing function of time, the intrinsic time field becomes:

$$T(x) = \frac{\hbar}{m \cdot c(t)^2} = \frac{\hbar}{m \cdot c_0^2 \cdot g(t)^2}$$

For propagating light with constant wavelength λ but changing speed c(t):

$$\nu(t) = \frac{c(t)}{\lambda} = \frac{c_0 \cdot g(t)}{\lambda}$$

A distant galaxy's light emitted at time t_em and observed at t_0 would show redshift:

$$z = \frac{\lambda_{obs} - \lambda_{em}}{\lambda_{em}} = \frac{c_0}{c(t_{em})} - 1 = \frac{1}{g(t_{em})} - 1$$

The gravitational potential in this interpretation becomes:

$$\Phi(x) = \ln\left(\frac{c_0^2}{c(x,t)^2}\right) = -2\ln\left(\frac{c(x,t)}{c_0}\right)$$

Yielding a force:

$$\vec{F} = -\nabla\Phi = 2\frac{\nabla c}{c}$$

This perspective replaces mass gradients with speed of light gradients as the source of gravitational effects, aligning with Dickey's approach while maintaining mathematical consistency with the T0 framework.

### 3. Hybrid Interpretation: Variable Mass and Variable c

The most general interpretation combines both variable mass and variable speed of light within the T0 framework:

$$T(x) = \frac{\hbar}{m(x,t) \cdot c(x,t)^2}$$

I can postulate a relationship between m and c such that:

$$m(x,t) \cdot c(x,t)^2 = m_0 \cdot c_0^2 \cdot h(x,t)$$

Where h(x,t) is a function describing their combined variation. The gravitational potential becomes:

$$\Phi(x) = -\ln\left(\frac{T(x)}{T_0}\right) = \ln(h(x,t))$$

This gives a force:

$$\vec{F} = -\nabla\Phi = -\frac{\nabla h}{h}$$

For cosmological redshift in this hybrid interpretation:

$$z = \frac{m(t) \cdot c(t)^2}{m_0 \cdot c_0^2} - 1 = h(t) - 1$$

## Fundamental Incompatibilities

Despite the initial mathematical compatibility suggested by the three interpretations explored above, deeper analysis reveals several fundamental incompatibilities between variable speed of light theories and the core architecture of the T0 model:

### 1. Violation of Natural Unit System

The T0 model is fundamentally built on a unified natural unit system where:

$$\hbar = c = G = k_B = \alpha_{\text{EM}} = \alpha_W = \beta_T = 1$$

This normalization is not merely a mathematical convenience but a theoretical necessity that reflects the model's premise of energy-based unification. A variable speed of light directly contradicts this principle, as it changes one of the foundational constants that should remain invariant. The concept of a "variable constant" creates an internal contradiction within the model's mathematical framework.

### 2. Inconsistency in Gravitational Derivation

My derivation of emergent gravitation within the T0 model proceeds from the intrinsic time field $T(x)$ with constant $c$:

$$\Phi(\vec{x}) = -\ln\left(\frac{T(x)}{T_0}\right)$$

With variable $c$, this entire derivation chain becomes problematic, as the relationship between $T(x)$ and the gravitational potential would require fundamental reformulation. The static field equation:

$$\nabla^2 T(x) \approx -\frac{\rho}{T(x)^2}$$

which leads to Newton's law without spacetime curvature, loses its elegant derivation when $c$ is variable.

### 3. Disruption of Quantized Length Scales

The T0 model establishes a hierarchy of quantized length scales spanning 97 orders of magnitude, from sub-Planckian to cosmic regimes, following the quantization law:

$$L_n = l_P \times \prod_i \alpha_i^{n_i}$$

A variable $c$ would disrupt this entire structure, as the Planck length $l_P = \sqrt{\hbar G / c^3}$ would itself become variable, destroying the quantized nature of these scales and undermining the model's predictive power regarding stable physical structures.

### 4. Breakdown of Higgs Parameter Relationships

The derivation of $\beta_T = 1$ in the T0 model relies on its relationship to Standard Model parameters:

$$\beta_T = \frac{\lambda_h^2 v^2}{16 \pi^3} \cdot \frac{1}{m_h^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\xi}$$

A variable $c$ would invalidate this derivation, as the Higgs parameters themselves would require redefinition in a framework where fundamental constants vary.

### 5. Inconsistency in Field Equations

The T0 model's field-theoretic formulation, including the modified Schrödinger equation:

$$i\hbar T(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi + i\hbar \Psi \frac{\partial T(x)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi$$

assumes constant base units. With variable $c$, the entire QFT treatment of the intrinsic time field would require reformulation, compromising the model's quantum mechanical foundations.

### 6. Electromagnetic Constants and Fine Structure Constant

The normalization α_EM = 1 is a central element of the T0 model that leads to simplification of electromagnetic equations:

$\alpha_{\text{EM}} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\hbar c} = 1$

With variable c, this relationship would require reinterpretation. Since the speed of light is defined as $c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}$, a variable c would either require variable electromagnetic constants ($\mu_0$, $\varepsilon_0$) or the fine structure constant itself would have to become variable. This would compromise the entire electrodynamics within the model and invalidate the relationship:

$e = \sqrt{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \approx 3.544$

### 7. Cosmological Correlation Length

The cosmological correlation length $L_T$ in the T0 model is defined as:

$\frac{L_T}{l_P} = \beta_T^{-1/4} \xi^{-1/2} \approx 3.9 \times 10^{62}$

This fundamental quantity, directly related to the cosmological parameter $\beta_T$, would be destabilized by a variable c, as the Planck length $l_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$ itself would become time-dependent. This would undermine the entire relationship between micro and macro scales in the model.

### 8. Thermodynamic Constants and Wien's Displacement Law

The T0 model normalizes $\alpha_W = 1$, leading to a direct equation of temperature and frequency:

$\omega_{\text{max}} = T$

With variable c, this relationship would become more complicated, as the frequency $\nu_{\text{max}} = \frac{k_B T}{h}$ depends on the Planck constant. The entire treatment of thermodynamic constants would need to be reconsidered.

### 9. Biological Anomalies in Forbidden Zones

A fascinating aspect of the T0 model is the explanation of biological structures in otherwise "forbidden zones" through:

$\nabla^2 T(x)_{\text{bio}} \approx -\frac{\rho}{T(x)^2} + \delta_{\text{bio}}(x,t)$

With variable c, this explanation for the uniqueness of biological systems would lose its mathematical foundation, as the exact location of these forbidden zones in the size scale would no longer be stable.

### 10. Transformation of Spacetime and Emergent Properties

The Lorentz transformations in the T0 model:

$T(x) = \frac{T_0}{\gamma}, \quad m = \gamma m_0$

are based on constant c in the definition of $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. A variable c would lead to time-dependent transformation laws, which would undermine the entire relativistic structure of the model.

## Conceptual Comparison of Paradigms

To grasp the difference between the T0 model and VSL theories more clearly, it is helpful to compare the fundamental paradigms directly:

| Aspect | T0 Model | VSL Theory | Standard Cosmology |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Time | Absolute | Relative | Relative |
| Mass | Variable | Constant | Constant |
| Speed of Light | Constant (c = 1) | Variable | Constant |
| Spatial Expansion | No real expansion | No real expansion | Real expansion |
| Redshift explained by | Mass variation | Decrease of c | Doppler + Expansion |
| Quantization | Fundamental scales | Not specified | Non-quantized |
| Unit system | Fully unified | Partially unified | Conventional |

This table clarifies that despite similar predictions regarding cosmological phenomena, the T0 model and VSL theories are based on fundamentally different assumptions. The strength of the T0 model lies in its complete unification and consistent treatment of mass as a variable quantity, while time remains absolute.

## Mathematical Challenges of a Hybrid Approach

The attempt to develop a hybrid approach that encompasses both variable mass and variable speed of light encounters several mathematical challenges:

1. **Non-unique parameterization**: The equation $m(x,t) \cdot c(x,t)^2 = m_0 \cdot c_0^2 \cdot h(x,t)$ allows infinitely many possible combinations of m and c for a given h, leading to ambiguities.

2. **Conservation laws**: The conservation of energy and momentum becomes more complicated when both m and c can vary, as the relativistic energy $E = \gamma mc^2$ now has two variable components.

3. **Quantum field theoretical treatment**: The complete quantization of the intrinsic time field $T(x)$ becomes significantly more complex if c is variable, as the renormalization group flow curves would have to be recalculated.

4. **Symmetry breaking**: The fundamental symmetries of the model, especially Lorentz invariance, could be broken by a variable c, leading to new theoretical challenges.

These mathematical difficulties, combined with the conceptual incompatibilities already discussed, reinforce the conclusion that the T0 model should be maintained in its original form with constant c, rather than being modified to accommodate variable speed of light.

## Experimental Considerations

While the variable speed of light could potentially explain certain cosmological observations like redshift, it would do so at the expense of the T0 model's internal consistency. The original T0 formulation already provides explanations for:

1. **Wavelength-Dependent Redshift**: Through the formula z(λ) = z₀(1 + ln(λ/λ₀)).
2. **Static Universe Model**: Without requiring physical expansion of space.
3. **Modified Gravity**: Via the potential Φ(r) = -M/r + κr.

These explanations emerge naturally from the constant-c T0 framework without requiring variable fundamental constants.

## Conclusion

While the mathematical exploration of variable speed of light within the T0 model context is an interesting theoretical exercise, it ultimately reveals profound incompatibilities with the foundational principles of the T0 framework. The strength and elegance of the T0 model lies precisely in its unification through constant natural units and the intrinsic time field's role as a mediator between quantum mechanics and relativity.

Rather than attempting to incorporate variable speed of light into the T0 model, a more fruitful approach would be to recognize these as distinct theoretical frameworks with different foundational assumptions. The T0 model's variable mass approach and the VSL theory both attempt to explain similar phenomena through different mechanisms, ultimately highlighting the importance of foundational assumptions in theoretical physics.

The T0 model's consistent internal architecture, spanning from quantum to cosmological scales with constant natural units, remains its most compelling feature and should be preserved rather than compromised to accommodate alternative frameworks.
