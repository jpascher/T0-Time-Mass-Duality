# T0-Time-Mass-Duality: A Unified Framework for Quantum Mechanics and Relativity

## Project Overview

The T0 model presents a revolutionary approach to fundamental physics through **time-mass duality**, where the intrinsic time field T(x,t) = 1/max(m(x,t), ω) provides a unified treatment of quantum mechanics and relativity. This framework operates in natural units where ℏ = c = α_EM = β_T = 1, reducing all physical quantities to powers of energy.
