# Time-Mass Duality

## A Theoretical Framework for Extending Modern Physics

Welcome to the repository of the Time-Mass Duality research program by Johann Pascher. This repository contains a coherent collection of works that develop a new theoretical framework for extending modern physics.

## Overview

At the center of this research is the concept of time-mass duality, which proposes a fundamental reformulation of the relationship between time and mass. This approach offers not only a possible path toward unifying quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity, but also provides new perspectives on fundamental phenomena such as nonlocality, dark matter, and dark energy.

The publications found here form a coherent research program that ranges from theoretical foundations to concrete applications and experimentally verifiable predictions. New documents on measurement differences, temperature adjustments, natural units, and scale interactions further expand the program.

**Important Update (April 2025)**: A new document has been added that explores the ontological equivalence of different perspectives within the T0 model. This work demonstrates how seven fundamental ontological truths can be approached from complementary viewpoints, all leading to identical predictions. This further validates the comprehensiveness of the T0 model by showing that seemingly different theoretical formulations are in fact equivalent representations of the same underlying reality.
