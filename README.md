# T0-Time-Mass-Duality: A Unified Framework for Quantum Mechanics and Relativity

## Project Overview

The T0 model presents a revolutionary approach to fundamental physics through **time-mass duality**, where the intrinsic time field T(x,t) = 1/max(m(x,t), œâ) provides a unified treatment of quantum mechanics and relativity. This framework operates in natural units where ‚Ñè = c = Œ±_EM = Œ≤_T = 1, reducing all physical quantities to powers of energy.

## Key Innovations

### Fundamental Principles

- **Three Field Geometries**: Localized spherical, localized non-spherical, infinite homogeneous
- **Natural Units**: ‚Ñè = c = Œ±_EM = Œ≤_T = 1 through deep theoretical connections
- **Parameter-Free Theory**: All constants derived from field theory without adjustable parameters

### Mathematical Framework
- **Universal Scale Parameter**: Œæ ‚âà 1.33 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥ from Higgs physics
- **Cosmic Screening**: Œæ_eff = Œæ/2 for infinite fields with Œõ_T = -4œÄGœÅ‚ÇÄ
- **Energy Loss Redshift**: z(Œª) = z‚ÇÄ(1 + ln(Œª/Œª‚ÇÄ)) - distinctive T0 signature

## Theoretical Significance

The T0 model represents a fundamental paradigm shift:

1. **No Spatial Expansion**: Cosmological redshift through energy loss to time field gradients
2. **Emergent Gravitation**: Gravitational effects from time field gradients rather than spacetime curvature  
3. **Unified Coupling**: Œ±_EM = Œ≤_T = 1 reveals fundamental unity of electromagnetic and time field interactions
4. **Complete Self-Consistency**: All parameters interconnected through field-theoretic relationships
5. **Cross-Scale Unification**: Same framework applies from sub-Planckian to cosmological scales

## Mathematical Completeness

All equations maintain strict dimensional consistency in natural units:
- Field equation: ‚àá¬≤m = 4œÄGœÅm (localized) or ‚àá¬≤m = 4œÄGœÅm + Œõ_T m (infinite)
- Characteristic lengths: r‚ÇÄ = 2Gm (localized), r‚ÇÄ,eff = Gm (cosmic screening)
- Energy loss rate: dE/dr = -g_T œâ¬≤ 2G/r¬≤ with complete dimensional verification
- Quantum evolution: Modified Schr√∂dinger equation with time field coupling

## Distinctive Features

**Versus Standard Model:**
- Zero free parameters vs. >20 adjustable constants
