Hier ist eine überarbeitete README-Datei auf Englisch, die die genannten Schwerpunkte weiter betont – insbesondere die Unification von Quantenmechanik (QM), Quantenfeldtheorie (QFT) und spezieller Relativitätstheorie (SRT) auf eine gemeinsame Basis durch das T0-Modell. Die zentralen Aussagen (alles auf eine Energieeinheit zurückzuführen, 
\alpha = 1
, Unvollständigkeit der QM mit Konsequenzen für Instantaneität) bleiben im Fokus.
T0-Time-Mass-Duality
Overview
This repository introduces the T0 model, a framework based on absolute time and variable mass, contrasting with relativity’s relative time and constant mass paradigm. It unifies all physical phenomena through a single energy unit, 
E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
, where 
T_0
 is an absolute time constant. By setting the fine-structure constant 
\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137}
 to 1 in natural units, it reveals a fundamental unity across forces and scales. Crucially, the model exposes the incompleteness of current quantum mechanics (QM), necessitating its extension with intrinsic time 
T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}
, and offers a common foundation to reconcile QM, quantum field theory (QFT), and special relativity theory (SRT). This resolves apparent instantaneity in quantum phenomena through mass-dependent dynamics.
Short Description:
Unifying QM, QFT, and SRT through a single energy unit in the T0 model with absolute time and variable mass, addressing QM’s incompleteness and instantaneity.
Content
Core Principles
Unified Energy Unit: All physics reduces to 
E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
, linking mass, time, and energy under an absolute time scale 
T_0
.
Fine-Structure Constant: Setting 
\alpha = 1
 in natural units simplifies interactions, unifying fundamental forces and scales.
Time-Mass Duality: Contrasts standard time dilation (variable time, constant mass) with the T0 model (absolute time, variable mass, 
m = \gamma m_0
), where 
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}
.
Unifying QM, QFT, and SRT
Common Basis: The T0 model integrates QM, QFT, and SRT by redefining time and mass dynamics under 
E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
, bridging their conceptual gaps.
QM Extension: Current QM lacks intrinsic time 
T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}
, requiring a modified Schrödinger equation for mass-dependent evolution, aligning it with QFT and SRT.
SRT Reinterpretation: Time dilation is reinterpreted as mass variation, maintaining consistency with relativistic effects while grounding them in absolute time.
Implications for Quantum Mechanics
Incompleteness of QM: Without intrinsic time, QM fails to fully describe mass-energy dynamics, necessitating an extension.
Beyond Instantaneity: Quantum entanglement’s apparent instantaneity is reframed as a mass-driven process, eliminating nonlocality via variable mass adjustments.
Unified Lagrangian: Combines gravitation, Standard Model forces, Higgs field, and intrinsic time, providing a coherent framework for QM and QFT.
Dark Energy and Cosmology
Energy Exchange Medium: Dark energy (
\rho_{DE}(r) = \frac{\kappa}{r^2}
) drives photon energy loss (
E_{\gamma}(x) = E_{\gamma,0} e^{-\alpha x}
), explaining redshift without expansion.
Static Universe: Energy conversion into dark energy, unified under 
E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
, replaces cosmic expansion.
Galaxy Dynamics
Mass Variation: Flat rotation curves result from effective mass variation (
m_{eff}(r) = m_0 \cdot f(\phi_{DE}(r))
) or a modified gravitational constant, negating dark matter.
Parameter Unity: Connects 
\alpha = H_0/c
, 
\kappa \approx 4.8 \times 10^{-7} \text{ GeV/cm}\cdot\text{s}^{-2}
, and 
\beta \approx 10^{-3}
 to the energy unit.
Experimental Tests
Mass-dependent quantum coherence and correlation delays.
Photon energy loss aligned with 
\alpha = H_0/c
.
Modified gravitational effects testable via lensing and galaxy dynamics.
Core Concept
The T0 model unifies physics through 
E = \frac{\hbar}{T_0}
 with absolute time and variable mass, setting 
\alpha = 1
 to simplify interactions. It provides a common basis for QM, QFT, and SRT, revealing QM’s incompleteness and extending it with intrinsic time 
T = \frac{\hbar}{mc^2}
. This reframes instantaneity as a mass-dependent effect, offering a consistent alternative to standard models.
Background
This work builds on studies of time-mass duality, spanning foundational principles, quantum extensions, field theory integration, and cosmological applications.
Goals
Unify QM, QFT, and SRT on a single energy-based foundation.
Extend QM to address its incompleteness and instantaneity.
Offer testable predictions to distinguish T0 from standard models.
Reframe cosmology and galaxy dynamics without expansion or dark matter.
