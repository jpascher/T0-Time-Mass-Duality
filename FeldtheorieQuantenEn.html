<p>This work develops a new perspective on quantum correlations and
their apparent instantaneity within the framework of the T0 model.
Through a unified field approach, it demonstrates how the nonlocal
properties of quantum mechanics can be understood as a natural
consequence of an underlying field structure. Particular emphasis is
placed on the role of the quantum background and the interpretation of
modern Bell experiments. This viewpoint complements the time-mass
duality theory and provides a coherent framework to explain quantum
mechanical phenomena without assuming "spooky action at a distance."</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Quantum mechanics has long presented us with puzzles, particularly
regarding the nature of quantum correlations. The notion that two
particles, separated by vast distances, could be instantaneously
connected has intrigued scientists since Einstein’s famous critique of
"spooky action at a distance." Modern experiments, such as the
loophole-free Bell tests starting in 2015, have shown that these
correlations are real and surpass classical notions of locality and
causality. But how can we understand this phenomenon without abandoning
the foundational pillars of physics?</p>
<p>In this work, I propose viewing the nonlocality of the quantum world
not as mysterious instantaneity but as a natural property of a unified
quantum field developed within the T0 model framework. This model, based
on time-mass duality and treating time as an absolute quantity with
variable mass, offers a fresh perspective. Rather than seeing particles
as isolated objects, I interpret them as nodes or excitations of a
fundamental field, whose coherence explains the observed correlations.
This viewpoint builds on the time-mass duality work detailed in
"Time-Mass Duality Theory: Derivation of Parameters" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_params_2025"></span>, extending it
with a field-theoretic foundation. A central element is the intrinsic
time field <span class="math inline">\(T(x)= (\hbar)/(\max(m c^2,
ω))\)</span>, which determines the timescale of field nodes and
bridges quantum mechanics and cosmology.</p>
<p>My approach begins with the idea that the vacuum is not an empty
space but an active quantum background with defined properties,
expressed through the electric and magnetic field constants <span class="math inline">\(ε_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(μ_0\)</span>. Particles are not standalone
entities but stable patterns of this field, while quantum correlations
reflect the inherent coherence of the field state. Modern experiments,
such as the Vienna tests of 2015 <span class="citation" data-cites="Giustina2015"></span> or the "Big Bell Test" of 2018 <span class="citation" data-cites="BigBellTest2018"></span>, support this
interpretation by confirming nonlocality as a fact without requiring
instantaneous communication between particles. To mathematically
substantiate this perspective, I introduce a fundamental field equation
describing the dynamics of this unified field, linking it to the
modified quantum mechanics of the T0 model, as developed in "The
Necessity of Extending Standard Quantum Mechanics" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_quantum_2025"></span>. This work
aims to create a coherent narrative that unifies both experimental
findings and the theoretical foundations of the T0 model.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="the-vacuum-as-a-quantum-background"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> The Vacuum as a Quantum
Background</h1>
<p>The vacuum, as understood in modern physics, is far more than an
empty space. It is a dynamic medium characterized by fundamental
physical properties such as the electric field constant <span class="math inline">\(ε_0\)</span> and the magnetic field
constant <span class="math inline">\(μ_0\)</span>. These constants are
not mere mathematical tools but expressions of a deep structure that
defines the speed of light and enables the interactions of all fields in
the universe. In the T0 model, this vacuum is regarded as an active
quantum background forming the foundation for all physical phenomena,
including quantum correlations. A central relationship underscoring this
role is:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[c = (1)/(\sqrt{ε_0
μ_0)}\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(1)</span></div></p>
<p>This background is not a passive stage but a carrier medium enabling
electromagnetic waves and other fundamental fields. Its homogeneity
ensures that the speed of light remains constant, as required by special
relativity. However, in the T0 model, the vacuum’s significance extends
further: it directly influences the intrinsic time field <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span>, which determines each particle’s
timescale, as shown in "Time-Mass Duality Theory" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_params_2025"></span>. The vacuum thus becomes key to
understanding the nonlocal properties of the quantum world, acting as a
coherent medium that sustains correlations across vast distances.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="quantum-correlations-in-the-field-model"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Quantum Correlations in the Field
Model</h1>
<p>When we speak of entangled particles, we often think of photons whose
polarization is described by a shared state. A typical entangled state
is:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[|ψ\rangle = (1)/(\sqrt{2)}
(|H\rangle_A |H\rangle_B + |V\rangle_A |V\rangle_B)\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(2)</span></div></p>
<p>In the traditional view, these particles appear as separate objects
whose states correlate instantaneously upon measurement. However, in the
T0 model’s field approach, this perspective fundamentally changes.
Entangled states are not properties of isolated particles but coherent
patterns of a unified quantum field permeating space, as described in
"Dynamic Mass of Photons" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_photons_2025"></span>.</p>
<p>The Bell inequalities, formulated by John Bell in 1964, clearly
demonstrate that local realistic theories cannot account for the
observed correlations. Mathematically expressed, one such inequality
is:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[|E(a,b) - E(a,c)| ≤ 1 +
E(b,c)\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(3)</span></div></p>
<p>In experiments, this inequality is consistently violated, as
demonstrated by Alain Aspect in 1982 and subsequent tests <span class="citation" data-cites="Aspect1982"></span>. In the field model,
this violation is unsurprising: the quantum field is inherently nonlocal
because it possesses a global structure that connects local measurements
without requiring signal transmission.</p>
<p>The Vienna experiments of 2015, led by Anton Zeilinger, marked a
milestone by closing all classical loopholes—such as detection
efficiency or spatial separation <span class="citation" data-cites="Giustina2015"></span>. With a significance exceeding 11
standard deviations, they confirmed nonlocality. Equally impressive was
the "Big Bell Test" of 2018, where over 100,000 people worldwide
controlled measurement settings to address the freedom-of-choice
loophole <span class="citation" data-cites="BigBellTest2018"></span>.
These experiments demonstrate that quantum correlations are real, and in
the T0 field model, they find a natural explanation as properties of a
coherent quantum field.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="field-theory-and-instantaneity"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Field Theory and
Instantaneity</h1>
<p>To make the concept of instantaneity more tangible, I draw an analogy
to sound waves. When a sound wave travels through a room, it is present
everywhere, yet a microphone measures only the local vibration. Two
microphones recording the same wave exhibit a correlation not due to
instantaneous communication between them but due to the shared structure
of the wave. Similarly, in the quantum field model, entangled particles
are nodes of a global field, and their correlations are inherent in the
field state before measurement occurs.</p>
<p>This analogy resolves the nonlocality paradox. There is no "action at
a distance," but rather an inherent coherence of the field, controlled
by the intrinsic time field <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span>,
as described in "Dynamic Mass of Photons" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_photons_2025"></span>. The Higgs field plays a
central role here, defining the mass and thus the timescale of the field
nodes, linking the observed correlations to time-mass duality.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="field-equations-in-dual-formulation"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Field Equations in Dual
Formulation</h1>
<p>Quantum mechanics in the T0 model is described by a modified
Schrödinger equation that incorporates variable mass. Unlike the
classical form <span class="math inline">\(i\hbar
(∂)/(∂ t) Ψ = \hat{H} Ψ\)</span>, it is
expressed here as:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[i\hbar T(x)(∂)/(∂ t)
Ψ + i\hbar Ψ (∂ T(x))/(∂ t) = \hat{H}
Ψ\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(4)</span></div></p>
<p>This approach, developed in "The Necessity of Extending Standard
Quantum Mechanics" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_quantum_2025"></span>, reflects time-mass duality
and integrates it into field theory. The total Lagrangian density of the
model is: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{Total}} =
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Boson}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Fermion}} +
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Higgs-T}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}}\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(5)</span></div>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}_{\text{intrinsic}} =
(1)/(2) ∂_μ T(x)∂^μ T(x)- V(T(x))\)</span>
describes the dynamics of the time field, as elaborated in "Mathematical
Core Formulations" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_lagrange_2025"></span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="cosmological-implications"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Cosmological Implications</h1>
<p>The T0 model has far-reaching implications for cosmology that align
with the field perspective. The gravitational potential is modified to
<span class="math inline">\(Φ(r) = -(G M)/(r) + κ
r\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(κ ≈
4.8e-11 m/s²\)</span> emerges from the <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span> dynamics, as shown in "Mass
Variation in Galaxies" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_galaxies_2025"></span>. Cosmic redshift is described
as energy loss: <span class="math inline">\(1 + z = e^{α
d}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(α ≈
2.3e-18 /m\)</span>, as derived in "Measurement
Differences" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_messdifferenzen_2025"></span>. A
wavelength-dependent redshift arises with <span class="math inline">\(z(λ) = z_0 (1 +
β_{\text{T}}\ln(λ/λ_0))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(β_{\text{T}}^{\text{SI}} ≈
0.008\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(β_{\text{T}}^{\text{nat}} = 1\)</span>, as
established in "Parameter Derivations" <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_params_2025"></span>. These effects demonstrate how
the quantum field model seamlessly integrates into the cosmological
aspects of the T0 model.</p>
<h1 data-number="7" id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>The T0 model offers a new perspective on quantum correlations by
explaining them as natural properties of a unified quantum field
controlled by the intrinsic time field <span class="math inline">\(T(x)\)</span>. This viewpoint resolves the
instantaneity paradox by interpreting nonlocality as an inherent
coherence of the field, supported by modern Bell experiments such as
those by Zeilinger and the "Big Bell Test." By integrating with
time-mass duality, as developed in the quantum mechanics and cosmology
works of the T0 model, it creates a coherent framework that transcends
the boundaries between quantum physics and field theory.</p>
