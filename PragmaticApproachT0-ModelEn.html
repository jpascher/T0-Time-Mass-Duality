<p>This paper examines the relationship between the T0 model of
time-mass duality and established calculation methods in physics, with
particular focus on the Dirac equation and relativistic formalisms. A
central aspect is the analysis of which elements have already been
successfully integrated into the T0 model and which still require formal
extension. The paper emphasizes that our scientific thinking is
historically shaped by the relativistic perspective, leading to
interpretive biases—particularly in cosmology. It is argued that the
experimental measurement data themselves are correct but must be
reinterpreted within the T0 framework. While the T0 model, with its
assumption of absolute time and variable mass, takes a fundamentally
different ontological standpoint, it can fully reproduce the
quantitative successes of established formalisms. The philosophical
implications of these competing but mathematically equivalent
descriptions are analyzed, as is the concrete development status of the
T0 formalism in various physical subfields.</p>

<h1 data-number="1" id="sec:introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>The development of modern physics in the 20th century is
characterized by two fundamental theories: relativity theory and quantum
mechanics. While these theories have achieved extraordinary success in
their respective domains, their unification remains one of the greatest
challenges of theoretical physics. The T0 model of time-mass duality
offers a novel approach to bridging this gap by questioning and
reinterpreting the fundamental assumptions of both theories.</p>
<p>In contrast to relativity theory, which postulates relative time and
constant mass, the T0 model inverts these assumptions: it introduces
absolute time and variable mass, mediated by the intrinsic time field
<span class="math inline">\(T(x,t)= (\hbar)/(\max(m(\vec{x),t)c^2,
ω(\vec{x},t))}\)</span>. This conceptual inversion raises the
question of how established calculation methods—particularly the Dirac
equation and relativistic formalisms—can be understood and integrated
into this alternative framework.</p>
<p>In this paper, we examine the current state of development of the T0
model regarding its integration of established calculation methods. We
analyze:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which aspects of established formalisms have already been
successfully integrated into the T0 model</p></li>
<li><p>Which areas still require further formal development</p></li>
<li><p>How experimental data traditionally interpreted in the
relativistic framework can be reunderstood in the T0 model</p></li>
<li><p>The philosophical implications of a parallel mathematical
description of physical reality</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A special focus is on the Dirac equation, which elegantly captures
spin and antimatter with its <span class="math inline">\(4 ×
4\)</span> matrix structure, as well as on the precise predictions of
General Relativity for gravitation-based phenomena.</p>
<p>The central thesis of this paper is that the T0 model does not stand
in confrontation with established calculation methods but integrates
them into a more comprehensive conceptual framework that leads to new
insights, particularly in cosmological questions.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="sec:historical_bias"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Historical Influence of the
Relativistic Perspective</h1>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="subsec:einstein_paradigms"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Einsteinian Paradigms and
Their Anchoring in Scientific Thinking</h2>
<p>Relativity theory has fundamentally shaped our understanding of
space, time, and gravitation since its formulation by Einstein over a
century ago. Its central concepts—the relativity of simultaneity, the
equivalence of mass and energy, spacetime curvature as the cause of
gravitation—have penetrated scientific thinking so deeply that they are
often no longer viewed as theoretical constructs but as indisputable
truths.</p>
<p>This historical influence leads to a specific interpretive bias,
where physical phenomena are automatically interpreted within the
framework of relativistic paradigms. Thomas Kuhn described in his work
"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhn1962"></span> how dominant paradigms shape not only
theoretical explanations but also the entire perception and
interpretation of observations.</p>
<p>The relativistic bias is particularly evident in three areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the <strong>language of physics</strong>, where terms like
"spacetime curvature," "time dilation," and "mass-energy equivalence"
are used as self-evident descriptions of physical reality</p></li>
<li><p>In the <strong>interpretation of measurements</strong>, where
experimental data are routinely interpreted within the relativistic
framework without considering alternative conceptual frameworks</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>theoretical developments</strong> that introduce new
phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy to maintain relativistic
basic assumptions rather than questioning these assumptions
themselves</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This issue of historical influence is particularly discussed in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0-ModelAsCompleteTheory_En.pdf">The
T0 Model as a More Complete Theory</a> (in the chapter
"Misinterpretations of Incomplete Theories"), where the dangers of
misinterpreting incomplete theories as ontologically correct are
addressed.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="subsec:data_reinterpretation"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Reinterpretation of
Measurement Data: Facts vs. Interpretation</h2>
<p>A fundamental aspect of the T0 model is the distinction between
experimental measurement data and their interpretation. The measurement
data themselves—be it the precession of Mercury, light deflection by the
Sun, or cosmic redshift—are not disputed. What is newly evaluated is the
conceptual framing of these measurements.</p>
<p>The redshift of light from distant galaxies excellently illustrates
this point:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Measurement datum:</strong> The light of distant galaxies
shows a systematic shift toward longer wavelengths.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conventional interpretation:</strong> This redshift is
interpreted as a Doppler effect due to cosmic expansion, leading to the
Big Bang theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>T0 interpretation:</strong> The same redshift is
understood as energy loss of photons during their propagation through
the intrinsic time field, without cosmic expansion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both interpretations can explain the measurement data with equal
precision but with completely different conceptual and cosmological
implications. This distinction between measurement data and
interpretation is crucial for the scientific evaluation of the T0 model:
it is not an alternative "set of facts" but an alternative conceptual
framing of the same empirical data.</p>
<p>The detailed reinterpretation of cosmological measurement data is
extensively explained in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf">Bridging
Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II</a>

Interpretation").</p>

Model</h1>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="subsec:dirac_success"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Successes and Precision of the
Dirac Equation</h2>
<p>The Dirac equation <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[(iγ^μ
∂_μ - m)ψ = 0\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(1)</span></div> represents one of the most remarkable
successes of theoretical physics. Its achievements include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>unification of quantum mechanics and special
relativity</strong> for fermions in a coherent mathematical
structure</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>prediction of the existence of antimatter</strong>,
which was later experimentally confirmed by the discovery of the
positron</p></li>
<li><p>A natural explanation for the <strong>intrinsic spin</strong> of
electrons and other fermions</p></li>
<li><p>The basis for <strong>quantum electrodynamics (QED)</strong>,
which enables physical predictions with a precision of up to 13 decimal
places</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These impressive successes make the Dirac equation a benchmark for
any alternative physical theory, including the T0 model.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="subsec:dirac_integration"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Integration Already Achieved in
the T0 Model</h2>
<p>Analysis of the documents shows that the T0 model has already made
substantial progress in integrating the Dirac equation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <strong>extension of the modified Schrödinger
equation</strong>: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[i\hbar
T(x,t)(∂Ψ)/(∂ t) + i\hbar Ψ \left[(∂
T(x,t))/(∂ t) + \vec{v}·∇ T(x,t)\right] = \hat{H}
Ψ\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(2)</span></div> forms the basis for relativistic quantum mechanics in the
T0 framework. This equation is derived in detail in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/DynamicTF-SchrodingerExtensions_En.pdf">Dynamic
Extension of the Intrinsic Time Field</a> (in the chapter on "Extended
Schrödinger Equation").</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>interpretation of spin</strong> as an intrinsic
property of the interplay between the time field and quantum systems is
developed in detail in several documents.</p></li>
<li><p>An approach to the <strong>explanation of antimatter</strong> as
a specific configuration of the time field is present, with charge
conjugation understood as a reversal of certain time field
properties.</p></li>
<li><p>The conceptual framework for an <strong>extension of the time
field to a tensor or complex field</strong> that can naturally capture
spin degrees of freedom is developed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These advances show that the T0 model does not reject the central
aspects of the Dirac equation but reinterprets them within an
alternative conceptual framework.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="subsec:dirac_extensions"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Remaining Extension Needs</h2>
<p>Despite substantial progress, there are areas that require further
formal development:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An <strong>explicit mathematical formulation</strong> that shows
how the <span class="math inline">\(4 × 4\)</span> matrix structure
of the Dirac equation can be directly derived from the T0
formalism</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>formal derivation of the spin-statistics
theorem</strong> in the context of the T0 model to explain the
connection between spin and Fermi-Dirac statistics</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precision calculations for QED phenomena</strong> such as
the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in the T0 formalism to
enable direct comparisons with conventional results</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These remaining developments do not represent conceptual obstacles
but rather the natural development path of a comprehensive physical
theory, as discussed in the earlier sections of this document (see
Section <span class="math inline">\(Introduction\)</span> on
the development trajectory).</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="sec:relativistic_calculations"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Relativistic Calculations in the
T0 Model</h1>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="subsec:gr_tests"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Classical Tests of General
Relativity</h2>
<p>General Relativity (GR) has made a series of precise predictions that
have been confirmed by observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>perihelion precession of Mercury</strong> (43 arc
seconds per century)</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>light deflection</strong> by the Sun during solar
eclipses</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>gravitational redshift</strong> of light in
gravitational fields</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gravitational waves</strong>, as detected by LIGO and
Virgo</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>structure of black holes</strong>, confirmed by the
Event Horizon Telescope</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These predictions represent another benchmark for the T0 model.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="subsec:gr_reproduction"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Successful Reproduction of
Relativistic Effects</h2>
<p>The T0 model can successfully reproduce all these effects through its
modified gravitational potential: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[Φ(r) =
-(GM)/(r) + κ r\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(3)</span></div></p>
<p>The documents show that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Gravitational waves</strong> in the T0 model are
described as the propagation of disturbances in the time field,
according to the dynamic field equation: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[∂_{μ}∂^{μ}T(x,t)+ T(x,t)+
\frac{ρ(\vec{x},t)}{T(x,t)^2} = 0\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(4)</span></div> This interpretation is
developed in detail in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/EmergentGravT0En.pdf">Emergent
Gravitation in the T0 Model</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Black holes</strong> are understood as extreme
configurations of the time field that provide equivalent predictions to
the relativistic Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Perihelion precession</strong> and other classical tests
are precisely described by the time field dynamics, as explained in
Section <span class="math inline">\(Quantitative Calculation of Classical Tests\)</span> of this
document.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This successful reproduction of relativistic effects shows that the
T0 model is not a rejection of established physical insights but a
reinterpretation within a more comprehensive conceptual system.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.3" id="subsec:cosmological_reinterpretation"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Cosmological
Reinterpretations</h2>
<p>The most significant difference between the T0 model and conventional
relativistic interpretation is evident in cosmology:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cosmic redshift:</strong> Rather than as an expansion
effect, this is interpreted as energy loss of photons during their
propagation through the time field.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wavelength-dependent redshift:</strong> The T0 model

<h2 data-number="4.4" id="subsec:esm_redshift"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Curvature-Based Redshift in the
Extended Standard Model</h2>
<p>An important aspect of the Extended Standard Model (ESM) that
deserves special attention is its mechanism of redshift. In contrast to
the conventional standard model, which explains redshift as a Doppler
effect through cosmic expansion, and also different from the T0 model
with its energy loss mechanism, the ESM offers a curvature-based
explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Curvature-induced deflection:</strong> Light is deflected
by mass distributions and the modified curvature term <span class="math inline">\(κ\)</span> in the gravitational potential
<span class="math inline">\(Φ(r) = -(GM)/(r) + κ
r\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy loss through deflection:</strong> This deflection
leads to a systematic energy loss of light during its propagation, which
manifests as redshift.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No expanding universe:</strong> Like the T0 model, the
ESM also postulates a static universe, where redshift arises not through
expansion but through this curvature-based mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mathematical equivalence:</strong> Despite the different
conceptual mechanism, the mathematical formulation leads to identical
observable predictions as the T0 model, including the
wavelength-dependent redshift.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This curvature-based interpretation of the ESM represents an elegant
bridge between the relativistic spacetime concept and the static
universe model. It retains the concept of curved spacetime but
fundamentally differently interprets its effects than the standard
model. This creates a fascinating situation where three different
conceptual frameworks—the conventional standard model with an expanding
universe, the T0 model with time field-based energy loss, and the ESM
with curvature-based deflection—exist, with the latter two leading to
mathematically equivalent predictions.</p>
<p>These conceptual differences are analyzed in detail in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0vsESM_ConceptualAnalysisEn.pdf">Conceptual

Positions</h2>
<p>The T0 model and the Extended Standard Model (ESM) offer two
fundamentally different ontological frameworks that nevertheless lead to
mathematically equivalent predictions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>T0 Model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Postulates <strong>absolute time</strong> and <strong>variable
mass</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Uses the <strong>intrinsic time field</strong> <span class="math inline">\(T(x,t)\)</span> as a fundamental concept</p></li>
<li><p>Explains gravitation as an <strong>emergent effect</strong> of
the time field gradient</p></li>
<li><p>Interprets redshift as <strong>energy loss</strong> through time
field interaction</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended Standard Model (ESM):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintains <strong>relative time</strong> and <strong>constant
mass</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Introduces a <strong>scalar field</strong> <span class="math inline">\(Θ(\vec{x},t)\)</span> that modifies spacetime
curvature</p></li>
<li><p>Describes gravitation through <strong>modified spacetime
curvature</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Explains redshift through <strong>light deflection and energy
loss</strong> due to this curvature</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These fundamental differences in the ontological basis lead to
completely different worldviews—despite identical empirical predictions.
This illustrates how profound the interpretive freedom in physics can
be, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/T0vsESM_ConceptualAnalysisEn.pdf">Conceptual

<h2 data-number="5.2" id="subsec:mathematical_equivalence"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Mathematical Equivalence
Despite Conceptual Differences</h2>
<p>The mathematical equivalence of both models is established through a
transformation between their fundamental fields:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[Θ(\vec{x},t) ∝
\ln\left((T(x,t))/(T_0)\right)\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(5)</span></div></p>
<p>This logarithmic relationship makes it possible to translate any
calculation in one formalism into the other. The most important
equivalences include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Gravitational potential:</strong> In both models <span class="math inline">\(Φ(r) = -(GM)/(r) + κ r\)</span>, but
with different conceptual justification</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wavelength-dependent redshift:</strong> Both models
predict <span class="math inline">\(z(λ) = z_0 (1 +
β_{\text{T}}\ln(λ/λ_0))\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gravitational waves:</strong> Both models describe the
same wave effects, but once as time field disturbances, once as
curvature waves</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Static universe:</strong> Both reject cosmic expansion in
favor of a static cosmology</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This mathematical equivalence makes the models empirically
indistinguishable but reinforces the importance of conceptual and
philosophical analysis as a decision criterion, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf">Bridging
Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II</a>

<h2 data-number="5.3" id="subsec:redshift_mechanism_detail"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> The Redshift Mechanism in
Detail</h2>
<p>The redshift mechanism clearly shows the different conceptual
approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>T0 Model:</strong> Redshift arises through direct energy
loss of photons during their propagation through the time field,
according to the differential equation: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[(dE)/(dx) = -α E \left(1 +
β_{\text{T}}\ln\left((λ)/(λ_0)\right)\right)\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(6)</span></div>
The photons lose energy (and are redshifted) through direct interaction
with the intrinsic time field, as explained in <a href="https://github.com/jpascher/T0-Time-Mass-Duality/tree/main/2/pdf/English/QMRelTimeMassPart2En.pdf">Bridging
Quantum Mechanics and Relativity through Time-Mass Duality: Part II</a>
(in the section on "Photon Energy Loss").</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ESM:</strong> Redshift arises through the deflection of
light in the modified spacetime curvature. The deflection itself leads
to an energy loss, which manifests as redshift: <div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[(dE)/(dx) = -(E)/(c^2)
(dΦ(x))/(dx) \left(1 +
β_{\text{T}}\ln\left((λ)/(λ_0)\right)\right)\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(7)</span></div>
Here, the energy loss is coupled to the gradual deflection of light by
the modified gravitational potential.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both differential equations lead to the identical phenomenological
relationship <span class="math inline">\(1 + z = e^{α d}\)</span>
for the redshift over distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>,
but the underlying physical mechanism is understood fundamentally
differently.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.4" id="subsec:philosophical_evaluation"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Philosophical Evaluation of the
Equivalence</h2>
<p>The situation of the T0 model and the ESM is philosophically
comparable to other cases of empirically equivalent theories:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Copernican vs. Ptolemaic system:</strong> With sufficient
epicycles, the geocentric worldview could provide the same predictions
as the heliocentric one, but with a completely different conceptual
framework.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Matrix mechanics vs. wave mechanics:</strong>
Heisenberg’s and Schrödinger’s different formulations of quantum
mechanics were later recognized as mathematically equivalent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bohmian vs. Copenhagen interpretation:</strong> Two
fundamentally different interpretations of quantum mechanics that lead
to the same empirical predictions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, criteria such as theoretical elegance, simplicity, or
fruitfulness are often used. The T0 model and the ESM both offer
elegance and simplicity, but in different ways: the T0 model through its
ontological parsimony and natural choice of units, the ESM through its
proximity to established relativistic concepts.</p>
<p>This equivalence illustrates the fundamental insight that scientific
theories do not depict reality "in itself" but represent models that are
always shaped by conceptual framings. The decision between these models
is ultimately a question of scientific and philosophical preference—with
empirical adequacy being only one, albeit important, criterion.</p>

relativity: the question of which entities "really" exist—curved

aspects:</p>
<ol>

better or more elegantly. The possible replacement of the expansion

Development of an explicit formulation that shows how the Dirac
structure emerges from the T0 formalism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Detailed quantum field theory of the time field:</strong>

<p>These developments could transform the T0 model from a promising

<h1 data-number="10" id="sec:conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Summary and Conclusions</h1>
<p>The analysis shows that the T0 model is not a rejection but a
reinterpretation of established calculation methods and experimental
data. Particularly noteworthy is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>The successful integration</strong> of the Dirac equation
and relativistic effects into the T0 framework, albeit with conceptually
different interpretation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The substantial treatment</strong> of spin, antimatter,
gravitational waves, and other established phenomena in the time field
formalism</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The identification of specific areas</strong> that
require further formal development, such as the explicit <span class="math inline">\(4 × 4\)</span> matrix structure of the Dirac
equation in the T0 context</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The philosophical insight</strong> that different
conceptual frameworks can lead to mathematically equivalent but
ontologically different descriptions of the same physical
reality</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The historical influence of our scientific thinking by the
relativistic perspective has possibly led to interpretive biases,
particularly in cosmology. The T0 model offers an alternative
interpretation that respects experimental measurement data but
understands them in a conceptually different framework.</p>
<p>The crucial question is not whether the measurement data are
correct—they are—but which conceptual framework explains them most
elegantly and comprehensively. The T0 model with its intrinsic time
field offers a promising alternative in this regard that deserves
further theoretical development and experimental testing.</p>
