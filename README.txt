# Time-Mass Duality

## A Theoretical Framework for Extending Modern Physics

Welcome to the repository of the Time-Mass Duality research program by Johann Pascher. This repository contains a coherent collection of works that develop a new theoretical framework for extending modern physics.

## Overview

At the center of this research is the concept of time-mass duality, which proposes a fundamental reformulation of the relationship between time and mass. This approach offers not only a possible path toward unifying quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity, but also provides new perspectives on fundamental phenomena such as nonlocality, dark matter, and dark energy.

The publications found here form a coherent research program that ranges from theoretical foundations to concrete applications and experimentally verifiable predictions. New documents on measurement differences and temperature adjustments further expand the program.

## Key Concepts

- **Intrinsic Time**: The concept of intrinsic time \( T = \hbar/mc^2 \) as a fundamental property of matter
- **Complementary Models**: The standard model (constant mass, variable time) and the T₀ model (absolute time, variable mass)
- **Dynamic Mass**: Extension of the concept to massless particles like photons
- **Modified Gravitational Model**: Explaining galactic rotation curves without dark matter
- **Unified Framework**: Integration of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity
