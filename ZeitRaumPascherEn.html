<p>Imagine looking at a familiar painting, one you’ve seen a hundred
times before. Then someone tilts it slightly, and suddenly you notice
details and patterns that had previously escaped you. That’s exactly
what I aim to do with our understanding of the universe. For over a
century, Einstein’s theories have shaped our view of time and space.
We’ve accepted that time is malleable—it slows down when you move
quickly or enter a strong gravitational field—while an object’s rest
mass is considered an unchanging property. This perspective has served
us well, from precise navigation with GPS satellites to observing the
deflection of light by the sun.</p>
<p>But I propose flipping this picture. In my T0 model, time is absolute
and flows uniformly, while mass becomes variable. This isn’t mere
speculation but a well-developed model that, with mathematical
formulations, explains the same experimental observations as Einstein’s
theories—only from an entirely new angle. This work invites you to
reconsider the familiar foundations of physics and asks whether a
different perspective might yield a clearer, more unified picture of
reality.</p>
<h1 data-number="1" id="the-clock-in-every-particle"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The Clock in Every Particle</h1>
<p>In the T0 model, every particle in the universe—be it an electron, a
proton, or a heavier muon—carries its own characteristic timescale,
which I call “intrinsic time.” This time is inversely proportional to
the particle’s mass and is defined as:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[T(x)= (\hbar)/(\max(m c^2,
ω))\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(1)</span></div></p>
<p>Heavy particles have faster internal clocks, while light particles
have slower ones. Take the muon as an example: in classical relativity,
we explain its extended lifetime as it races through the atmosphere with
time dilation—time stretches for the moving muon. In the T0 model, time
remains constant, but the muon’s mass changes. These two descriptions
lead to the same measurable outcomes, yet they offer vastly different
insights into the nature of reality. The mathematical equivalence is
detailed in “Time-Mass Duality Theory: Derivation of Parameters” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_params_2025"></span>, but intrinsic
time opens new pathways to understanding quantum phenomena.</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="when-distant-particles-are-connected"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> When Distant Particles Are
Connected</h1>
<p>Quantum entanglement—the phenomenon where two particles appear linked
across any distance—is one of physics’ most fascinating enigmas.
Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance” because standard
quantum mechanics describes it without truly explaining it. In the T0
model, this connection gains a new interpretation. Instead of assuming
instantaneous correlation, it depends on the mass of the involved
particles. Two entangled particles with different masses evolve with
distinct intrinsic times, causing a measurable delay in their
correlations—proportional to the ratio of their masses.</p>
<p>This idea, explored in depth in “Dynamic Mass of Photons” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_photons_2025"></span>, diverges
from the conventional view and offers a clear, testable prediction. It
challenges us to rethink the nature of nonlocality and demonstrates how
time-mass duality can provide a concrete alternative to traditional
quantum mechanics.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="rethinking-beginning-and-end"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Rethinking Beginning and End</h1>
<p>The T0 model also turns our conception of the universe upside down.
Classical cosmology envisions an expanding space where galaxies move
apart, observed as the redshift of light. In the T0 model, space remains
static, and redshift arises from an energy loss of light over time,
described as:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[1 + z = e^{α d}, \quad α
≈ 2.3e-18 /m\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(2)</span></div></p>
<p>This approach, elaborated in “Measurement Differences” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_messdifferenzen_2025"></span>,
resolves issues like the horizon problem more elegantly than inflation
theory and avoids the mathematical singularities of the standard model.
The Big Bang is not seen as the beginning of time and space but as a
state of extremely high energy and mass evolving over constant time.</p>
<p>For black holes, this means they lack a central singularity. The
event horizon marks a boundary of extreme mass variation, not an end to
time. This aligns with thermodynamics and sidesteps the information
paradox, as examined in “Mass Variation in Galaxies” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_galaxies_2025"></span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="a-fundamental-building-block-energy"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> A Fundamental Building Block:
Energy</h1>
<p>In the T0 model, all fundamental constants—the speed of light <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, Planck’s constant <span class="math inline">\(\hbar\)</span>, the gravitational constant <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>—are reduced to a single quantity:
energy. This unification is mathematically precise and reveals that
these constants are not independent values but facets of an underlying
energetic reality. While the standard model treats them as given, the T0
model derives them from simpler principles, as presented in “Parameter
Derivations” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_params_2025"></span>. It’s a simplification
reminiscent of the shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric
worldview—a profound reorientation of our view of natural laws.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="putting-it-to-the-test"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Putting It to the Test</h1>
<p>The T0 model isn’t just theoretical musing—it makes clear, testable
predictions that differ from the standard model. Bell tests with
particles of different masses could reveal correlation delays
proportional to their mass ratio, an effect described in “Dynamic Mass
of Photons” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_photons_2025"></span>. In quantum coherence
experiments, coherence times should vary with mass, detectable with
current technology. The modified Schrödinger equation with intrinsic
time, developed in “The Necessity of Extending Standard Quantum
Mechanics” <span class="citation" data-cites="pascher_quantum_2025"></span>, leads to distinct dispersion
relations for matter waves:</p>
<p><div style="position: relative; margin: 1em 0;"><span class="math display">\[i\hbar T(x)(∂)/(∂ t)
Ψ + i\hbar Ψ (∂ T(x))/(∂ t) = \hat{H}
Ψ\]</span><span class="equation-number" style="position: absolute; right: 0; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);">(3)</span></div></p>
<p>These predictions offer concrete ways to distinguish between models,
verifiable with today’s or soon-to-be-available technology.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="a-new-lens-a-clearer-picture"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> A New Lens, a Clearer
Picture</h1>
<p>My approach inverts the usual perspective without discarding the
experimentally confirmed laws of physics. The mathematical foundations
remain intact but are interpreted and expanded within a new framework.
This inversion echoes the transition from the geocentric to the
heliocentric worldview: the observations stay the same, but the
explanation becomes more elegant and profound.</p>
<p>While standard physics seeks ways to unify quantum mechanics and
gravitation, the T0 model offers a direct solution through the
consistent treatment of time and mass. It addresses major unsolved
questions—dark matter, dark energy, the black hole information
paradox—and resolves many naturally, without the additional assumptions
required in the standard model.</p>
<p>The history of science shows that the greatest advances often arise
not from new data but from new perspectives. This work is a call to
reconsider familiar facts—not to replace them, but to gain a clearer,
more unified picture of reality. It’s a step toward a physics that is
more intuitive and comprehensive, perhaps the beginning of a revolution
in our understanding of the universe.</p>
